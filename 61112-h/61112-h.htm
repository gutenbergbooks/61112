To the Reader.</h3>


<p><i>Judicious Reader</i>,</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap3" src="images/a_003_t.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="T" /></div>

<p>here is abundance of knowledge,
yet but little truth
known. The generality of
our knowledg is but as Castles
in the aire, or groundlesse
fancies. I know but
two ways that are ordained for the getting
of wisdome, <i>viz.</i> the book of God, and of
Nature; and these also, but as they are read
with reason. Many look upon the former
as a thing below them, upon the latter as
a ground of Atheisme, and therefore neglect
both. It is my judgement, that as to
search the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Sciptures">Scriptures</span> is most necessary, so
without reason it is impossible. Faith without
reason is but implicite. If <i>I</i> cannot understand
by reason how every thing is, yet
<i>I</i> wil see some reason that a thing is so, before
<i>I</i> beleeve it to be so. I will ground my
beleeving of the Scripture upon reason,
I will improve my reason by Philosophy.
How shall we convince gain-sayers of the
truth of the Scriptures, but by principles
of Reason? When God made Man after his
own image, How was that? But by making
him a rational creature? Men therfore that
lay aside Reason in the reading of sacred
mysteries, do but un-man themselves, and
become further involved in a Labyrinth of
errors. Hence it is that their Religion is degenerated
into irrationall notions. Now to
say, that pure Philosophy is true Divinity,
will haply bee a paradox, yet if any
one should affirm it, he would not be heterodox.
When <i>Job</i> had been a long time
justifying himselfe against God, which I
conceive was by reason of his ignorance
of God, and himselfe; God undertakes to
convince him of his errour by the principles
of <i>N</i>ature, and to bring him to the
knowledge of both: as you may see at
large, <i>Job</i> 38. Can any deny that <i>Hermes</i>,
<i>Plato</i>, <i>Aristotle</i> (though pure Naturalists)
were not most deep Divines? Doe not all
grant that the two first cha. of <i>Gen.</i> are true
Divinity? I dare also affirm that they are
the most deep and the truest Philosophy.
Yea, they are the ground, and sum of all
Divinity, and Philosophy: and if rightly
understood, will teach thee more knowledge
of God, and thy selfe, then all the
books in the world besides. Now for the
better understanding of them, make use of
most profound <i>Sandivogius</i> the author of
the first of the ensuing Treatises, as the best
Expositor of them: in that treatise of his
thou shalt see the mystery of the Deity, &amp;
Nature unfolded, even to admiration: as to
see what that light, and fire is which is the
throne of Gods Majesty. How he is in the
heaven most gloriously, &amp; in the creatures
providentially. <i>H</i>ow he is the life of that
universall Spirit which is diffused through
the whole world. What that Spirit of his
is that moved upon the Waters. What
those Waters are which are above the
Firmament, and which are under the Firmament.
What that Sperm and Seed was
which God put into all creatures by which
they should be multiplyed. The true manner
of Mans Creation, and his degenerating
into Mortality. The true nature of the Garden
of <i>Eden</i>, or Paradise. Also the reason
why Gold, which had a Seed put into it, as
well as other creatures, whereby it should
be multiplyed, doth not multiply. What
the obstruction is, and how it may bee removed,
that so it may be digested into the
highest purity, and become the true Elixir,
or Philosophers stone; the possibility
whereof is so plainly illustrated in this
book of <i>Sandivogius</i>, that let any judicious
man read it over without all partiality
and prejudice, but three or four times, and
he shall <i>nolens volens</i> be convinced of the
truth of it, and not only of this, but of many
other mysteries as incredible as this. So
that if any one should ask me, What one
book did most conduce to the knowledge
of God and the Creature, and the mysteries
thereof; <i>I</i> should speake contrary to
my judgment, if I should not, next to the
sacred Writ, say <i>Sandivogius</i>. All this I
speak for thy encouragement, that thou
shouldst lay aside other frivolous bookes,
and buy this, and read it over, &amp; thou wilt
(I question not) thank mee for my advice.</p>

<p>And as this booke doth in generall, so
the second of these Treatises doth in particular
illustrate the possibility of Nature,
and the mysteries thereof, as also the nature
and manner of the Generation,
Growth, Conservation, Life, Death, Renewing,
Transmutations, <i>S</i>eparations, and
Signatures of all naturall things, in the explication
of which many rare experiments
and excellent mysteries are discovered
and found out.</p>

<p>To these is added a Chymical Dictionary,
explaining hard places, and words met
withall in obscure Authors. But this, and
the other I speak more sparingly in the
commendations of, because if read they
will speak more for them selves then I can
speak for them: only <i>I</i> was willing for the
<i>English</i> nations sake, whose spirits are
much drawn forth after knowledge, to
translate them into the <i>English</i> tongue.
<i>I</i> did not doe it to multiply books, (for
there are too many books already; and the
multitude of them is the greatest cause of
our ignorance, and in them is a great vanity)
but to let thee see the light of Nature,
by which thou maist judg of truths, and
the better conceive of the God of <i>N</i>ature,
of whom all naturall things are full, and
whose goings forth in the way of <i>N</i>ature
are most wonderfull, even to the conviction
of the greatest Atheists.</p>

<p><i>Courteous Reader</i>, thou must excuse me for
not affecting elegancies in these Translations,
for if I were skilled in them, yet the
matter of the books would not bear them.
If I have sometimes used uncouth words, it
was because the sense, to which <i>I</i> kept me
close, would not properly bear any other,
or at least better came not at the present
into my mind. <i>I</i>f any <i>Errata’s</i> have passed
through the slips of my pen, or the <i>Printers</i>
mistake, be thou candid, and mend them. <i>I</i>f
thou shalt not approve of what <i>I</i> have
done, convince mee of my errour by doing
better; for thereby thou shalt oblige the
lovers of truth, and amongst the rest, thy
friend</p>

The Preface.</h3>

to God for a blessing upon all the Searchers
of <i>Alchymie</i>, namely the true Sons
of <i>Hermes</i>.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap3" src="images/a_009_w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="W" /></div>
<p>hen I considered with
my self, that many adulterated
books, and false
Receipts (as they call
them) of <i>Alchymists</i>,
composed through the fraud, and covetousnesse
of Impostors, in which not so
much as one spark of truth appears,
were in request with the Searchers of
Naturall, and mysterious Arts, by
which even very many have been, and
still are deceived: I thought I could do
no better service, then to communicate
that talent, committed to my trust by
the Father of Lights, to the Sons and
Heirs of Wisdome. And to this end,
that future ages may take notice, that
this singular Philosophicall blessing of
God hath not been denyed to some
men, not only in former ages, but also
in this. It seemed good to me for some
Reasons to conceal my name, whilst I
doe not seek praise to my selfe, but endeavour
to be assisting to the lovers of
Wisdome. Therefore I leave that vain
desire of honour to those that had rather
seem to bee, then to bee indeed.
What here I write by way of testimony
to that undoubted Philosophicall
truth, comprehended in few lines, have
been taken out of that Manuall experience,
which the most High hath vouchsafed
to mee, that they which have laid
the principall, and reall foundations in
this commendable Art, may by this
encouragement not forsake the practise
of the best things, and so bee secured
from that wicked swarm of smoke-sellers,
whose delight is to cheat. They are
not dreams, as the ignorant vulgar call
them; neither are they foolish inventions
of idle men, as fools, and men void
of understanding (who deride the Art)
conceive them to be. <i>I</i>t is the Philosophicall
truth it selfe, which as <i>I</i> am a
lover of the truth, I ought not, nay <i>I</i>
could not for supporting and confirming
the truth of <i>Alchymie</i>, undeservedly
cryed out against, keep close, or bury
in silence. Although it may bee much
afraid in these times (when vertue and
vice are esteemed alike) by reason of the
unworthinesse of this age, and ingratitude,
and treachery of men (to say nothing
of the curses of Philosophers) to
come forth upon the publick stage of
the world. <i>I</i> could produce witnesses
of this Chymicall truth, <i>viz.</i> sage Authors,
according to the unanimous
consent of divers honorable Ancients
in so many severall nations: but those
things which are manifest by ocular experiment,
need no further proof. Many
men both of high, and low condition in
these last years past, have to my knowledge
seen <i>Diana</i> unvailed. And although
there may be found some idle,
and ill-employed fellowes, who either
out of envy, or malice, or fear of having
their own frauds discovered, cry out
that the soule may bee extracted out of
Gold, and with the specious, and deceitfull
delusion of ostentation, say it
may be put to another body; not without
losse and detriment of time, pains,
and costs: yet let the sonnes of <i>Hermes</i>
know for certaine, that such a kind of
extraction of souls (as they call them)
whether out of Gold, or out of Silver
(by what vulgar way of <i>Alchymie</i> soever)
is but a meer fancy: which thing
indeed is not beleeved by many, but at
length by experience, the onely, and
true Mistris of truth is verified, and
that with losse. On the contrary, hee
which (in a Philosophicall way) can
without any fraud and colourable deceit
make it, that it shall really tinge
the basest metall, whether with gain, or
without gain, with the colour of Gold,
or Silver (abiding all requisite tryalls
whatsoever) I can justly averre hath the
gates of Nature opened to him, for the
enquiring into further, and higher secrets,
and with the blessing of God to
obtain them. Moreover, I present these
present Treatises, composed out of
mine own experience, to the Sonnes of
Art, that whilst they are busied with all
their thoughts and intentivenesse of
mind in searching into the secret operations
of Nature, they may thence
know, and cleerly understand the truth
of all things, and Nature it selfe: in
which thing alone the perfection of the
whole sacred Philosophicall Art consists,
so that they go on in the common
high-way of Nature, which shee prescribes
in all her operations. Therefore
<i>I</i> would have the Courteous Reader
be here admonished, that he understand
my Writings not so much from the
outside of my words, as from the possibility
of Nature; lest afterward he bewaile
his time, pains, and costs, all spent
in vain. Let him consider that this Art
is for the wise, not for the ignorant; and
that the sense, or meaning of Philosophers
is of another nature then to bee
understood by vapouring <i>Thrasoes</i> or
Letter-learned scoffers, or vicious against
their owne consciences, (who
whilst they cannot rise by their vertues,
attempt it by their villanies, and malicious
detractings from honest men) or
ignorant Mountebanks, who most unworthily
defaming the most commendable
Art of <i>Alchymie</i>, have with their
Whites, and Reds deceived almost the
whole world. For it is the gift of God,
and truly it is not to be attained to, but
by the alone favor of God, enlightning
the understanding together w<sup>th</sup> a patient
and devout humility (or by an ocular
demonstration from some experienced
Master:) wherefore God justly thrusts
them far from his secrets that are strangers
to him. Finally, My only request
to the Sonnes of Art is this, that they
would take in good part my endeavouring
to deserve well of them, and
when they shall have made that which
is occult manifest, and through the
good pleasure of God in a constant
way of diligence shall arrive to the
longed for haven of the Philosophers,
that they would, according to the custome
of Philosophers, debarre all unworthy
men from this Art; and not
forgetting to love their poor neighbor
in the feare of God (setting aside all
vain ostentation) let them sing everlasting
praises of thankfulnesse unto
the great and good God, for so speciall
a gift, and use it wel with a silent and
religious joy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Simplicity or plainnesse is the seal of
truth.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap3" src="images/b_001_m.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="M" /></div>

<p>any wise, and very learned men many
ages since, yea (Hermes testifying
the same) before the floud
wrote many things concerning
the making the Philosophers stone;
and have bequeathed so many
writings unto us, that unlesse Nature
should daily worke things credible
to us, scarce any one would beleeve it as a truth
that there were any nature at all: because in former ages
there were not so many devisers of things, neither did
our Ancestors regard any thing besides nature it selfe,
and the possibility of nature. And although they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
contented with the plaine way alone of nature, yet they
found out those things, which we now imployed about
divers things could not with all our wits conceive. This
is because nature, and the generation of things in the
world is esteemed of us meane, and plaine. And therefore
we bend our wits not to things knowne, and familiar,
but to such things, which not at all, or very hardly
can be done. Wherefore it happens that we are more
dexterous in devising curious subtilties, and such which
the Philosophers themselves did never thinke of, then to
attain to the true processe of nature, &amp; the right meaning
of Philosophers. And such is the disposition of mens natures,
as to neglect those things they know, and to
be alwaies seeking after other things; such also and
much more is that of mens wits, and fancies, to
which their nature is subjected. As for example; You
see any Artificer, when he hath attained to the highest
perfection of his Art, either searcheth into other
Arts, or abuseth the same, which he already hath, or
else leaves it off quite. So also is generous nature alwaies
active and doing to its very Iliad (<i>i</i>) utmost period, and
afterward ceaseth. For there is given to nature from
the beginning a certaine kinde of grant, or permission
still to attaine to things better, and better through her
whole progresse, and to come to her full rest, towards
which she tends with all her might, and rejoyceth in
her end, as a Pismire doth in her old age, at which
time nature makes her wings. Even so our wits have
proceeded so farre, especially in the Phylosophicall Art,
or praxis of the stone, that now we are almost come to
the Iliad it selfe. For the Art of Chymistry hath now
found out such subtilties, that scarce greater can be invented,
and differ as much from the Art of the Anci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>ent
Philosophers as a Clock-smith doth from a plaine
Black-smith: And although both worke upon Iron,
yet neither understands the others labours, although
both are masters of their Art. If Hermes himselfe, the
father of Philosophers, should now be alive, and subtil-witted
<i>Geber</i>, together with most profound <i>Raimundus
Lullius</i>, they would not be accounted by our Chymists
for Philosophers, but rather for Scholars: They would
be ignorant of those so many distillations, so many
circulations, so many calcinations, and so many other
innumerable operations of Artists now adayes used,
which men of this age devised, and found out of their
writings. There is one only thing wanting to us, that is, to
know that which they effected, <i>viz.</i> the Philosophers
stone, or Physicall Tincture, we, whilest we seeke that,
finde out other things: and unlesse the procreation of
man were so usuall as it is, and nature did in that thing
still observe her owne law, and rules, we should scarce
not but erre. But to returne to what I intended; I promised
in this first treatise to explaine Nature, lest
every idle fancy should turne us aside from the true and
plaine way. Therefore I say Nature is but one, true,
plaine, perfect, and entire in its owne being, which God
made from the beginning, placing his spirit in it: but
know that the bounds of nature is God himselfe, who
also is the originall of nature. For it is certaine, that every
thing that is begun, ends no where but in that, in which
it begins. I say it is that only alone, by which God
workes all things: not that God cannot worke without
it (for truly he himselfe made nature, and is omnipotent)
but so it pleaseth him to doe. All thing proceed
from this very nature alone; neither is there any thing
in the world without nature. And although it happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
sometimes that there be abortives; this is not natures
fault, but of the Artist, or place. This nature is divided
into foure places, in which she works all these things,
which appeare to us under shadowes; for truely things
may be said rather to be shadowed out to us, then really
to appeare. She is changed in male, and female, and is
likened to Mercury, because she joynes her selfe to various
places; and according to the goodnesse, or the badnesse
of the place she brings forth things; although to us
there seeme no bad places at all in the earth. Now for
qualities there be only foure, and these are in all things,
but agree not, for one alwaies exceeds another. Moreover,
nature is not visible, although she acts visibly; for
it is a volatile spirit, which executes its office in bodies,
and is placed, and seated in the will, and minde of God.
Nature in this place serves us for no other purpose, but
to understand her places, which are more sutable, and
of nearer affinity to her; that is, to understand how to
joyne one thing to another, according to nature, that
we mixe not wood and man together, or an oxe or any
other living creature, and metals together: but let every
thing act upon its owne like: and then for certaine nature
shall performe her office. The place of nature is
no other then, as I said before, what is in the will of
God.</p>

<p>The searchers of nature ought to be such as nature her
selfe is, true, plaine, patient, constant, &amp;c. and that which
is chiefest of all, religious, fearing God, not injurious
to their neighbour. Then let them diligently consider,
whether their purpose be agreeable to nature; whether
it be possible, let them learne by cleare examples, <i>viz.</i>
Out of what things any thing may be made, how, and
in what vessell nature workes. For if thou wilt doe any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
thing plainly, as nature her selfe doth doe it, follow
nature; but if thou wilt attempt to doe a thing better
then nature hath done it, consider well in what, and by
what it is bettered, and let it alwaies be done in its owne
like. As for example, if thou desirest to exalt a metall
in vertue (which is our intention) further then nature
hath done; thou must take a metalline nature both
in male and female, or else thou shalt effect nothing.
For if thou dost purpose to make a metall out of hearbs,
thou shalt labour in paine, as also thou shalt not bring
forth wood out of a dog, or any other beast.</p>

<i>THE SECOND TREATISE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the operation of Nature in our intention,
and in Sperme.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_005_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;said even now that nature was true, but one,
every where seene, constant, and is knowne
by the things which are brought forth, as
woods, hearbs, and the like. I said also that
the searcher of nature must be true, simple hearted,
patient, constant, giving his minde but to one
thing alone, &amp;c. Now we must begin to treat of the
acting of Nature. As nature is in the will of God,
and God created her, or put her upon every imagination;
so nature made her selfe a seed, (<i>i</i>) her will, and
pleasure in the Elements. She indeed is but one, and
yet brings forth divers things; but workes nothing
without a sperme: Nature workes whatsoever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
sperme pleaseth, for it is as it were an instrument of
some Artificer. The sperme therefore of every thing is
better, and more advantagious to the Artificer, then nature
her selfe. For by nature without seed, you shall
doe as much as a Goldsmith shall without fire, gold, or
silver, or a husbandman without corne, or seed. If thou
hast the sperme, nature is presently at hand, whether it
be to bad, or good. She workes in sperme, as God doth
in the free will of man: and that is a great mysterie, because
nature obeyes the sperme, not by compulsion,
but voluntarily; even as God suffers all things, which man
wills, not by constraint, but out of his owne free pleasure:
Therefore he gave man free will whether to bad,
or to good. The sperme therefore is the Elixir of every
thing, or Quintessence, or the most perfect decoction, or
digestion of a thing, or the Balsome of Sulphur, which
is the same as the Radicall moisture in metalls. There
might truely be made a large discourse of this sperme;
but we shall onely keep to that which makes for our
purpose in the Chymicall Art. Foure Elements beget
a sperme through the will, and pleasure of God, and
imagination of nature: for as the sperme of man hath
its center, or vessell of its seede in the kidnies; so the
foure Elements by their never ceasing motion (every
one according to its quality) cast forth a sperme into
the Center of the earth, where it is digested, and by
motion sent abroad. Now the Center of the earth is
a certaine empty place, where nothing can rest. The
foure Elements send forth their qualities into excentrall
parts of the earth, or into the circumference of the
Center. As a man sends forth his seed into the entrance
of the wombe of the woman; in which place nothing
of the seed remaines, but after the wombe hath received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
a due proportion, casts out the rest: so also it comes
to passe in the Center of the earth, that the magnetick
vertue of the part of any place drawes to it selfe any thing
that is convenient for its selfe, for the bringing forth
of any thing; the residue is cast forth into stones, and
other excrements. For all things have their originall
from this fountaine, neither hath any thing in the
world any beginning but by this fountaine. As for
example; let there be set a vessell of water upon a smooth
even table, and be placed in the middle thereof, and
round about let there be laid divers things, and divers
colours, also salt, and every one apart: then let the
water be powred forth into the middle; and you shall
see that water to runne abroad here and there, and when
one streame is come to the red colour, it is made red
by it, if to the salt, it takes from it the taste of the
salt, and so of the rest. For the water doth not change
the place, but the diversity of the place changeth the water.
In like manner the seed, or sperme being by the
foure Elements cast forth from the center into the circumference,
passeth through divers places; and according
to the nature of the place, it makes things: If it comes to
a pure place of earth, and water, a pure thing is made.
The seed, and sperme of all things is but one, and yet
it produceth divers things, as is evident by the following
example. The seed of a man is a noble seed, and was
created, and ordained for the generation of man onely;
yet nevertheless if a man doe abuse it, as is in his free
will to doe, there is borne an abortive. For if a man
contrary to Gods most expresse command should couple
with a cow, or any other beast, the beast would presently
conceive the seed of the man, because nature is
but one; and then there would not be borne a man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
a beast, and an Abortive; because the seed did not find a
place sutable to it self. By such an inhumane, &amp; detestable
copulation of men with beasts there would be brought
forth divers beasts, like unto men. For so it is, if the
sperme goes into the center, there is made that which
should be made there; but when it is come into any
other place, and hath conceived, it changeth its forme
no more. Now whilest the sperme is yet in the center,
there may as easily be brought forth a tree, as a metall
from the sperme, and as soone an hearbe, as a stone, and
one more pretious then another, according to the purity
of the place: But how the Elements beget a sperme
is in the next place to be treated of, and it is done thus:
The Elements are foure: two are heavy and two are
light, two dry, and two moist, but one which is most
dry, and another which is most moist, are males,
and females &amp;c. Every one of these of it selfe is most
apt to produce things like unto it selfe in its owne sphere,
and so it pleased God it should be: These foure never
are at rest, but are alwaies acting one upon another; and
every one by it selfe sendeth forth his owns thinness, and
subtlety, and they all meet in the center: now in the
center is the Archeus, the servant of nature, which
mixeth those spermes, and sends them forth. And
how that is done is to be seene more fully in the Epilogue
of the 12 treatises.</p>

<i>THE THIRD TREATISE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the true first matter of Metalls.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_009_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" /></div>

<p>he first matter of Metalls is twofold, but
the one cannot make a metall without the
other. The first and principall is the humidity
of the aire mixed with heat; and this
the Philosophers called Mercury, which is governed
by the beams of the Sunne, and Moon in the Philosophicall
sea: the second is the dry heat of the earth,
which they called Sulphur. But because all true Philosophers
chiefly concealed this, wee will a little
more cleerly explain it; especially the weight or
poise, which being unknown, all things are spoiled.
Thence it is, that many bring forth an abortive out
of that which is good; for there bee some that take
the whole body for the matter, or seed, or sperme;
and some that take a piece, and all these go beside the
right way. As for example, if any one should take
the foot of a man, and the hand of a woman, and
would by mixing these two together make a man, it
were not possible to be done. For there is in every
body a Center, and a place or the point of the seed or
sperme, and is alwaies the 8200<sup>th.</sup> part, yea even in
every wheat corne; and this cannot bee otherwise.
For not the whole corne, or body is turned into seed,
but only a spark, or some certain small necessary part
in the body, which is preserved by its body from all
excessive heat and cold. If thou hast eares, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
sense, mark well what is here said, and thou shalt be
safe, and out of the number not only of those who
are ignorant of the place of the sperm, and endeavour
to convert the whole corn into seed; but also of them
all, who are employed in the fruitlesse dissolution of
metalls, and are desirous to dissolve the whole of
metalls, that afterwards by their mutuall commixtion
they may make a new metall. But these men,
if they considered the processe of Nature, should see
that the case is far otherwise; for there is no metall
so pure, which hath not its impurities, yet one more,
or fewer then another. But thou, friendly Reader,
shalt observe the first point of nature, as is abovesaid,
and thou hast enough: but take this caution along
with thee; that thou dost not seek for this point in
the metalls of the vulgar, in which it is not. For these
metalls, especially the gold of the vulgar, are dead, but
ours are living, full of spirit, and these wholly must
be taken: for know, that the life of metalls is fire
whilst they are yet in their mines; and their death is
the fire, <i>viz.</i> of melting. Now the first matter of
metals is a certaine humidity mixed with warm aire,
and it resembles fat water, sticking to every thing
pure, or impure, but in one place more abundantly
then in another, by reason the earth is more open,
and porous in one place then in another, having also
an attractive power. It comes forth into the light
somtimes by it self, with some kind of covering, especially
in such places where there was nothing that it
could well stick to; it is known thus, because every
thing is compounded of 3 principles: but in reference
to the matter of metalls is but one, without any conjunction
to any thing, excepting to its covering or
shadow, <i>viz.</i> sulphur, &amp;c.</p>

<p>etalls are brought forth in this manner.
After the foure Elements have sent forth
their vertues into the center of the earth,
the Archeus by way of distillation sends
them up unto the superficies of the earth, by vertue
of the heat of its perpetuall motion: for the earth is
porous, and this wind by distilling through the pores
of the earth, is resolved into water, out of which all
things are made. Therefore let the sons of wisdome
know, that the sperm of metalls doth not differ from
the sperm of all things, <i>viz.</i> the moist vapour: therefore
in vain do Artists look after the reducing of metalls
into their first matter, which is only a vapour.
The Philosophers meant not such a first matter, but
only the second matter, as <i>Bernardus Trevisanus</i> learnedly
discusseth it, though not so cleerly, because hee
speaks of the foure Elements, but yet hee did say as
much, but he spake only to the sons of Art. But <i>I</i>,
that I might the more cleerly open the Theorie,
would have all be admonished here to take heed how
they give way to so many solutions, so many circulations,
so many calcinations, and reiterations of the
same; for in vain is that sought for in a hard thing,
when as the thing is soft of it self, and every where
to be had. Let not the first, but the second matter
only be sought after, <i>viz.</i> that, which as soon as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
conceived, cannot be changed into another form. But
if thou inquirest how a metall may bee reduced into
such a matter, in that I keep close to the intention
of the Philosophers: This thing only above all the
rest I desire, that the sons of Art would understand
the sense, and not the letter of writings, and where
nature doth end, <i>viz.</i> in metallick bodies, which in
our eyes seem to be perfect, there must Art begin.
But to return to my purpose, (for my intention is not
here to speak of the stone only) let us now treate of
the matter of metalls. A little before I said, that all
things were made of the liquid aire, or the vapour,
which the Elements by a perpetuall motion distill into
the bowells of the earth; and then the Archeus
of Nature takes and sublimes it through the pores,
and according to its discretion distributes it to every
place (as we have declared in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: foregoingt reatises">foregoing treatises</span>)
so from the variety of places proceeds the variety of
things. There be some that suppose Saturne to have
one kind of seed, and Gold another, and so all the rest
of the metalls. But these are foolish fancies; there is
but one only seed, the same is found in Saturne which
is in Gold, the same in Silver which is in Iron; but
the place of the earth is divers, if thou understandest
me aright, although in Silver nature sooner hath done
its work, then in Gold, and so of the rest. For when
that vapour is sublimed from the center of the earth,
it passeth through places either cold, or hot: If therefore
it passeth through places that are hot, and pure,
where the fatnesse of Sulphur sticks to the walls; I
say that vapour which the Philosophers have called
the Mercury of Philosophers applyes it self to, and is
joined to that fatnesse, which then it sublimes with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
self; and then becomes an unctuosity, and leaving the
name of a Vapour, is called by the name of Fatnesse;
which afterward coming by sublimation unto other
places, which the foregoing vapour hath cleansed,
where the earth is subtill, pure, and moist, fills the
pores thereof, and is joined to it, and so it is made
Gold; but if that fatnesse come to impure, and cold
places, it is made Lead; but if the earth bee cold and
pure, and mixed with sulphur, it is made Copper, &amp;c.
For by how much more a place is depurated, or clensed,
by so much the more excellent it makes the metalls:
for wee must know, that that vapour goes out
continually from the center to the superficies, and
cleanseth those places through which it passeth.
Thence it comes to passe, that now there may bee
found Mines in those places where a thousand yeers
agoe were none; for in its passage it alwaies subtilizeth
that which is crude and impure, carrying it by
degrees with it: And this is the reiteration, and circution
of nature; it is so long sublimed in producing
new things, untill the place be very well purified; and
by how much the more it is purified, by so much the
nobler things it brings forth. Now in the winter
when the air is cold, binding fast the earth, that
unctuous vapour is congealed, which afterward when
the spring returns, is mixed together with earth, and
water, and so becomes a Magnesia, drawing to it self
the Mercury of air, like unto it selfe, and gives life to
all things through the concurrence of the beams of
the Sun, Moon and Stars, and so it brings forth grass,
flowers, and such like things. For Nature is not one
moment of time idle. Now Metalls are thus made,
the earth by long distillation is purified, then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
are generated by the accesse, or coming thither of
the fatnesse: they are brought forth no other way,
as is the foolish opinion of some that mis-interpret
the writings of Philosophers.</p>

<p>he matter of Stones is the same as of
other things; and according to the purity
of places they are made in this manner.
When the four Elements distill their vapour
into the center of the earth; and the Archeus of
nature sends forth the same, and sublimes it; this
whilst it passeth through places, and the pores of the
earth, takes along with it self all the impurity of the
earth unto the very superficies, which afterward the
air congeals (for what the pure air makes, the crude
aire congeals, because aire hath ingresse into aire, and
they join themselves together, for nature is delighted
in nature:) and so are made rocks, and stony mountains,
according to great and little pores. And by
how much the greater are the pores of the earth, by
so much the better is the place purified. Since therefore
by such a breathing place or vent, a greater heat,
and a greater quantity of water passeth, therefore the
sooner is the earth depurated: and so afterward in
those places metalls are more easily brought forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
Even so very experience testifies, that gold cannot be
got, or found any where but in mountains, and seldome
or never in plain, and levell ground: for most
commonly such places are moist, not with the vapour,
but with Elementary water, which drawes to
it self that vapour, and so they embrace one another,
as that they can hardly be separated; afterwards the
sun of the heavens digesting them, makes that fat
clay which the Potters use. But in places where there
is grosse sand, and whither the vapour doth not
bring with it that fatnesse, or sulphur, it brings forth
herbs and grasse in Meadows. There be other kind
of stones, which are called precious stones, as the
Diamond, Rubies, Emerald, and such like gems as
these, all which are generated after this manner.
When the vapour of Nature is sublimed by it selfe,
without being joined to the fatnesse of sulphur, and
comes to a place of pure salt water, there are made
Diamonds; and this is in cold places, whither that
fatnesse cannot come, because that fatness would hinder
the making of these stones. For wee must know,
that the spirit of water is sublimed easily, and that
with a small heat; but oil, and fatnesse cannot be carryed
up but with a great heat, and that also into hot
places; for when it is come from the center, if it meet
with any little cold, it is congealed, and is at a stand,
but the vapour ascends to its due places, and in pure
water is congealed into stones by grains. But how
colours are made in gems; wee must know that they
are made by reason of the sulphur in this manner: if
the fatnesse of the sulphur be congealed, then by that
perpetuall motion, the spirit of the water passing
through, it digests and purifies it by virtue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
salt, untill it bee coloured with a digested heate,
red or white, which colour tending toward a
further perfection, is carryed up by that spirit, because
it is subtilized and made thin by so many reiterated
distillations; the spirit afterward hath a power
to enter into imperfect things, and so brings in a colour
to them, which afterward is joined to that water,
being then in part congealed, and so fills up the
pores thereof, and is fixed with it, with an inseparable
fixation. For all water is congealed with heat, if it be
without spirit, &amp; congeled with cold, if it hath a spirit;
but he that knows how to congeal water with heat, &amp;
to join a spirit with it, shall certainly find out a thing
more pretious then gold, and every thing else. Let
him therefore cause that the spirit be separated from
the water, that it may putrifie, and bee like a graine.
Afterwards the feces being cast away, let him reduce
and bring back the spirit again from the deep into
water, and make them be joined together again: for
that conjunction will generate a branch of an unlike
shape to its parents.</p>

<i>THE SIXTH TREATISE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the second matter, and putrefaction of
things.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_017_w.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="W" /></div>

<p>ee have spoken of the first matter of
things, and how things are produced by
Nature without seed, that is, how Nature
receives matter from the Elements, out
of which she makes seed: But now we intend to treat
of the seed it selfe, and things generated of seed.
For every thing that hath seed is multiplyed in it, but
without the help of Nature it is not done: for the seed
is nothing else but the air congealed in some body: or
it is a moist vapour; and unlesse this be resolved by a
warm vapour, it is of no use. Let therefore the searchers
of the Art understand what Seed is, lest they
seek after a thing that is not: and let them know that
that is threefold, which is brought forth by the foure
Elements. The first is Minerall, and is that which we
now speak of; the second is Vegetable; the third Animall.
The Minerall seed is known by Philosophers
alone: the Vegetable is common, and vulgar, as
we may see in fruits: the Animall is known by imagination.
The Vegetable doth shew to us, how Nature
made it of the four Elements. For wee must
know that the winter is the cause of putrefaction, seeing
it congeals the Vitall spirits in trees; and when
those by the heat of the Sun (in which there is a mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>netick
vertue, attractive of al manner of moisture) are
resolved; then the heat of nature, stirred up by motion
drives, or forceth the subtill Vapour of the water to
the circumference, and this vapour openeth the pores
of the tree, and makes drops distill, alwaies separating
the pure from the impure. Yet the pure sometimes
goeth before the impure; the pure stayes, and is
congealed into flowers, the impure goes into leaves,
the grosse, and thick into the bark: the bark of the
tree remains fast, and firm, the leaves fall with cold,
or heat, when the pores thereof are stopt: the flowers
in congealing receive their colour according to the
heat whereby the colour is made, and bring with
them fruit, and seed (as an Apple, in which there is
sperm out of which a tree is not brought forth; but
in the inside of that sperme is a seed or kernell, out of
which even without the sperm is brought forth a tree,
for multiplication is not in the sperm, but in the seed.)
So wee see with our eyes, that Nature creates a seed
out of the four Elements, lest wee should labour in
vain about it; for what is created already need not a
Creator. Let this by way of example bee sufficient
for the advertisement of the Reader; but now I return
to my purpose concerning the Mineralls. Nature
creates the Mineral seed, or the seed of Metalls in the
bowels of the earth: wherefore it is not beleeved that
there is any such seed <i>in rerum naturâ</i>, because it is invisible.
But it is no wonder if ignorant men doubt of
it, seeing they cannot perceive that which is before
their eys, much less that which is hid from their eyes:
but it is most true that that which is superiour, is but
as that which is inferior, and so on the contrary.
Also that which is brought forth above is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
forth of the same fountaine, as that beneath in the
bowells of the earth. And what prerogative should
Vegetables have before Metalls, that God should put
a seed into them, and without cause withhold it from
these? Are not Metalls of as much esteem with God
as Trees? Let this be granted for a truth, that nothing
grows without seed: for where there is no seed, the
thing is dead. It is necessary therefore that four Elements
should make the seed of Metalls, or bring them
forth without a seed: if they are produced without
seed, then they cannot be perfect; seeing every thing
without seed is imperfect, by the rule of composition:
hee which gives no credit to this undoubted
truth, is not worthy to search into the secrets of nature;
for there is nothing made in the world, that is
destitute of seed. The seed of Metalls is truely, and
really put into them: and the generation of it is thus.
The foure Elements in the first operation of Nature
doe by the help of the Archeus of Nature distill into
the center of the earth a ponderous, or heavy Vapour
of water, which is the seed of Metalls, and is called
Mercury by reason of its fluxibility, and its conjunction
with every thing, not for its essence; and for its
internall heat it is likened to Sulphur, and after congealation
becomes to be the radicall moisture. And
although the body of Metalls be procreated of Mercury
(which is to bee understood of the Mercury
of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Philosphers">Philosophers</span>) yet they are not bee hearkned to,
that think the vulgar Mercury is the seed of Metalls,
and so take the body in stead of the seed, not considering
that the vulgar Mercury spoken of hath its own
seed in it self. The errors, and mistakes of all these
men will be made apparent by the following exam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>ple.
It is manifest that men have seed, in which they
are multiplyed: the body of man is Mercury; but
the seed is hid in the body, and in comparison to the
body is but little, and light: he therefore that will
beget a man, let him not take Mercury, which is the
body, but the seed, which is the congealed Vapour
of water. So in the regeneration of Metalls, the vulgar
Chymists goe preposterously to work: They
dissolve Metallick bodies, whether it be Mercury, or
Gold, or Lead, or Silver, and corrode them with
sharp waters, and other Heterogeneous things not
requisite to the true Art, and afterward joine them
together again, not knowing that a man is not generated
of a mans body cut to pieces, because by this
means the body is marred, and the seed before-hand
is destroyed. Every thing is multiplyed in Male and
Female, as I have already mentioned in the Treatise
of the twofold Matter: The division of the sexes causeth,
or produceth nothing, but a due joining of them
together, brings forth a new forme: the seeds therefore,
or spermes, not bodies are to bee taken. Take
therefore a living Male, and a living Female; joine
these together, that betwixt them there may be conceived
a sperm for the bringing forth of fruit after its
kind: There is no man living can beleeve that he can
make the first matter: The first matter of Man is
earth, and no man can of that make a man; only God
knows how to doe this; but of the second matter,
which is already made, if it be put into its due place,
may easily by the operation of Nature be generated
a thing of that species, or kind, which the seed was
of. The Artist here need doe nothing, onely to separate
the thin from the thick, and to put it into its due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
vessell. For this is to be considered, that as a thing is
begun, so it ends: Of one are made two, of two one,
and then you have done. There is one God; of this
one God the Son is begotten: One produceth two,
two have produced one holy Spirit proceeding from
both: so the world is made, and so shall be the
end thereof. Consider the four former points most
exactly: thou hast in them the Father, the Father
and the Son, and lastly the holy Spirit: thou hast the
four Elements: thou hast four great Lights, two Celestiall,
and two Centrall: This is all that is, hath
been, or shall be, that is made plain by this forenamed
similitude. If I might lay down all the mysteries that
might be raised from hence, they would amount to a
great volume. I return to my purpose, and I tell thee
true, my son! one is not made of one naturally, for
thus to doe is proper to God alone: let it suffice thee
that thou art able out of two to make one, which wil
be profitable to thee. Know therefore that the sperm
doth multiply the second matter, and not the first:
for the first matter of all things is not seen, but is hid
either in nature, or in the Elements; but the second
matter sometimes appeares to the sons of wisdome.</p>

<p>ut that thou maist the more easily conceive
what this second matter is, I will describe
the vertues of it, by which thou maist
know it. And first of all know, that Nature
is divided into three Kingdoms; two of them are such
that either of them can subsist of it self, if the other
two were not; there is the Minerall, Vegetable, and
Animall Kingdom. The Minerall can subsist of it self,
although there were no man in the world, nor tree, or
herb. The Vegetable likewise, although there were
no Metall, nor Animall, can stand by it self: these two
are of one made by one: But the third hath life from
the other two which wee have mentioned, without
which it could not subsist, and is more noble and excellent
then those two, as also it is the last of the three,
and rules over the other: because alwaies vertue, or
excellency ends in a third thing, and is multiplyed in
the second. Dost thou see in the Vegetable Kingdom?
The first matter is an herb, or a tree, which thou
knowest not how to make, Nature alone makes it: In
this Kingdom the second matter is Seed, which thou
seest, in this the hearb, or the tree is multiplyed. In
the Animall Kingdome the first matter is a beast, or
a man, which thou knowest not how to make; but the
second matter or the sperm, in which they are multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>plyed,
thou knowest. In the Minerall thou knowest
not how to make a Metall, and if thou braggest that
thou canst, thou art a foole, and a lyar, Nature makes
that, and although thou shouldst have the first matter,
according to the Philosophers, yet it would bee
impossible for thee to multiply that Centrall salt
without Gold: Now the seed of Metalls is known only
to the sons of Art. In Vegetables the seed appears
outwardly; the reins of its digestion is warm aire. In
Animalls the seed appears inwardly, and outwardly;
the reins of its digestion are the reins of a Male. Water
in Mineralls is the seed in the Center of their
heart, and is their life: the reins of its digestion is fire.
The receptacle of the Vegetable seed is the earth:
the receptacle of the seed Animal is the womb of the
female: the receptacle of water, which is the Minerall
seed, is aire. And those are the receptacles of seeds,
which are the congealations of their bodies: that is
their digestion, which is their solution: that is their
putrefaction which is their destruction. The vertue
of every seed is to join it self to every thing in its own
Kingdome, because it is subtill, and is nothing else
but aire, which by fatnesse is congealed in water: It is
known thus, because it doth not mixe it self naturally
to any thing out of its own Kingdome: it is not dissolved,
but congealed, because it doth not need dissolution,
but congealation. It is necessary therefore
that the pores of the body be opened, that the sperme
may be sent forth, in whose Center the seed lyes,
which is aire: that when it comes into its due matrix,
is congealed, and congeals what it finds pure, or impure
mixed with what is pure. As long as the seed is
in the body, the body lives, when it is all <span class="correction" title="In the original book: consumed consumed">consumed</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
the body dies; also all bodies after the emission
of seed are weakned: experience likewise testifies
that men which give themselves over too much
to venery become feeble, as trees, that bear too much
fruit, become afterwards barren. The seed therefore,
as oftentimes hath been repeated, is a thing invisible;
but the sperme is visible, and is almost a living
soule; it is not found in things that are dead: It is
drawn forth two wayes, pleasantly, and by force:
But because wee are in this place to treat of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: verte">vertue</span>
of it onely, I say that nothing is made without
seed: all things are made by vertue of seed: and
let the sons of Art know, that seed is in vain sought
for in trees that are cut off, or cut down, because it is
found in them only that are green.</p>

<p>ll seed is nothing worth of it self, if it
be not either by Art, or Nature put into
its proper matrix. And although
seed be of it self more noble then every
creature, yet the matrix is the life of it,
&amp; makes the sperm, or corn to putrefie, and causeth a
congealation of the pure point, and also by the heat
of its body nourisheth it, and makes it grow: and this
is done in all the foresaid Kingdomes of Nature; and
is done naturally by months, years, and ages. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
that is a witty Art, that can shorten any thing in the
Minerall, and Vegetable Kingdome, but not in the
Animall: in the Minerall Kingdome it perfects
that, which Nature could not, by reason of the
crude air, which with its vehemency filled the pores
of every body; not onely in the bowells, but also in
the superficies of the earth. As I have already said
in the foregoing Chapters. But that this may bee
the more easily understood, I will adde hereunto,
that the Elements striving amongst themselves send
forth their seed into the Center of the earth, as into
their reins; but the Center by help of motion sends
it into its Matrix. Now the Matrixes are innumerable,
as many Matrixes, as places, one purer then
other, and so almost <i>in infinitum</i>. Know therefore,
that a pure Matrix will afford a pure conception in
its own likenesse: As for example, in Animalls there
are Matrixes of Women, Cowes, Mares, Bitches,
and the like. So in the Minerall, and Vegetable
Kingdomes, there are Metalls, Stones, Salts; for the
Salts in these two Kingdomes are to bee considered
of, as also their places, according to more or lesse.</p>

bloud, and salt: so Silver is made of the same Seed
as Gold is, and in the same Matrix; but the Matrix
had more water in it then digested blood, according
to the season of the Moon in the heavens. But that
thou maist the more easily imagine with thy self how
Metalls couple together, that their Seed may be sent
forth, and received; behold and see the heavens, and
the spheres of the Planets: thou seest that <i>Saturne</i>
is placed the uppermost, or highest, next to that <i>Iupiter</i>,
then <i>Mars</i>, then <i>Sol</i>, or the Sun, then <i>Venus</i>, then
<i>Mercury</i>, and last of all <i>Luna</i>, or the Moon. Consider
also that the vertues of the Planets doe not ascend,
but descend: Experience teacheth as much, <i>viz.</i> that
of <i>Venus</i>, or Copper is not made <i>Mars</i>, or Iron, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
of <i>Mars</i> is made <i>Venus</i>, as being an inferiour sphere:
So also <i>Iupiter</i>, or Tin is easily changed into <i>Mercury</i>
or Quicksilver, because <i>Iupiter</i> is the second from
the firmament, and <i>Mercury</i> the second from the
earth: <i>Saturne</i> is the first from the heavens, and <i>Luna</i>
the first from the earth: <i>Sol</i> mixeth it self with all,
but is never bettered by its inferiors. Now know
that there is a great agreement betwixt <i>Saturne</i>, or
Lead, and <i>Luna</i>, or Silver, in midst of which the Sun
is placed: as also betwixt <i>Iupiter</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, in midst
of which <i>Sol</i> is also placed: and in the same manner
betwixt <i>Mars</i> and <i>Venus</i>, which also have <i>Sol</i> placed
in the midst of them. Chymists know how to change
Iron into Copper without Gold: they know also to
make Quicksilver out of Tin: and there are some
that make Silver out of Lead: But if they knew by
these mutations to give or minister to them the nature
of Gold, they would certainly find out a thing more
pretious then any treasure. Wherefore I say we must
not bee ignorant what Metalls are to be joined to
each other, whose nature is agreable one to the others.
Moreover there is granted to us one Metall, which
hath a power to consume the rest, for it is almost as
their water, &amp; mother: yet there is one thing, and that
alone, the radicall moisture, <i>viz.</i> of the Sunne, and
Moon that withstands it, and is bettered by it; but
that I may disclose it to you, it is called Chalybs, or
Steel. If Gold couples eleven times with it, it sends
forth its seed, and is debilitated almost unto death;
the Chalybs conceives, and bears a son, more excellent
then his father: then when the Seed of that
which is now brought forth is put into its own Matrix,
it purifies it, and makes it a thousand times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
more fit, and apt to bring forth the best, and most
excellent fruits. There is another Chalybs, which
is like to this, created by it selfe of Nature, which
knows how to draw forth by vertue of the sun beams
(through a wonderfull power, and vertue) that
which so many men have sought after, and is the
beginning of our work.</p>

<p>ee have treated of things, which Nature
makes, and which God hath made; that the
Searchers of Art might the more easily understand
the possibility of Nature. But to delay no
longer, I will now enter upon the Manner, and Art
how to make the Philosophers stone. The Philosophers
stone, or tincture is nothing else, but Gold digested
to the highest degree: For vulgar Gold is
like an herb without seed, when it is ripe it brings
forth seed; so Gold when it is ripe yeelds seed, or
tincture. But, will some ask, Why doth not Gold, or
any other Metall bring forth seed? the reason given
is this, because it cannot bee ripe, by reason of the
crudity of the air, it hath not sufficient heat, and it
happens, that in some places there is found pure
Gold, which nature would have perfected, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
hindred by the crude aire. As for example, wee see
that Orenge trees in <i>Polonia</i> doe indeed flourish as
other trees; in <i>Italie</i>, and elsewhere, where their naturall
soil is, they yeeld, and bring forth fruit, because
they have sufficient heat; but in these cold places they
doe otherwise, for when they begin to ripen, they are
at a stand, because they are oppressed with cold; and
so in these places we never have their fruit naturally:
but if at any time Nature be sweetly, and wittily
helped, then Art may perfect that, which Nature
could not. The same happens in Metalls: Gold may
yeeld fruit, and seed, in which it multiplyes it self by
the industry of the skilfull Artificer, who knows how
to exalt Nature, but if he will attempt to do it without
Nature, he will be mistaken. For not only in this
art, but also in every thing else, we can doe nothing
but help Nature; and this by no other medium then
fire, or heat. But seeing this cannot be done, since in
a congealed Metallick body there appear no spirits; it
is necessary that the body be loosed, or dissolved, and
the pores thereof opened, whereby Nature may
work. But what that dissolution ought to be, here I
would have the Reader take notice, that there is a
twofold dissolution, although there be many other
dissolutions, but to little purpose; there is onely one
that is truely naturall, the other is violent, under
which all the rest are comprehended. The naturall is
this, that the pores of the body bee opened in our
water, whereby the seed, that is digested, may bee
sent forth, and put into its proper Matrix: Now our
water is heavenly, not wetting the hands, not vulgar,
but almost rain water: The body is gold, which
yeelds seed; our Lune or Silver, (not common Silver)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
is that which receives the seed of the gold: afterwards
it is governed by our continual fire, for seven months,
and sometimes ten, untill our water consume three,
and leave one; and that <i>in duplo</i>, or a double. Then it
is nourished with the milk of the earth, or the fatnesse
thereof, which is bred in the bowells of the earth, and
is governed, or preserved from putrefaction by the
salt of Nature. And thus the infant of the second
generation is generated. Now let us passe from the
Theorie to the Praxis.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Praxis, and making of the

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_030_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" /></div>

<p>hrough all these foregoing Chapters, our
discourse of things hath been scattered by
way of examples, that the Praxis might
be the more easily understood, which must
be done by imitating Nature after this manner&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of our earth, through eleven degrees, eleven
graines, of our Gold, and not of the vulgar one grain,
of our Lune, not the vulgar, two grains: but be thou
well advised, that thou takest not common Gold, and
Silver, for these are dead, take ours which are living:
then put them into our fire, and let there be made of
them a dry liquor; first of all the earth wil be resolved
into water, which is called the Mercury of Philoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>phers;
and that water shall resolve those bodies of
Gold, and Silver, and shal consume them so, that there
shall remain but the tenth part with one part; and this
shall be the radicall moisture of Metalls. Then take
water of salt-nitre, which comes from our earth, in
which there is a river of living water, if thou diggest
the pit knee deep, therefore take water out of that, but
take that, which is cleer; upon this, put that radicall
moisture; and set it over the fire of putrefaction, and
generation, not on such a one as thou didst in the first
operation: govern all things with a great deale of
discretion, untill colours appear like a Peacocks
tail; govern it by digesting it, and be not weary, untill
these colours be ended, and there appear throughout
the whole one green colour, and so of the rest;
and when thou shalt see in the bottome ashes of a fiery
colour, and the water almost red, open the vessel,
dip in a pen, and smeare some Iron with it, if it tinge,
have in readinesse that water, which afterwards I shall
speak of, and put in so much of that water as the cold
aire was, which went in, boil it again with the former
fire, untill it tinge again. So far reached my experience,
I can doe no more, I found out no more. Now
that water must be the menstruum of the world, out
of the sphere of the Moon, so often rectified, untill
it can calcine Gold: I have been willing here to
discover to thee all things; and if thou shalt understand
my meaning sometimes, and not the letter, I
have revealed all things; especially in the first, and
second work. Now it remains that we speak next of
the fire. The first fire, or of the first operation is a fire
of one degree, continuall, which goes round the matter;
the second is a naturall fire, which digests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
fixeth the matter: I tell thee truely that I have opened
to thee the governance, or rules of the fire, if thou
understandest Nature: The vessell remains yet to
be spoken of. It must be the vessel of Nature, and
two are sufficient; the vessell of the first work must
be round; but in the second a glasse, a little lesse like
unto a viall, or an egge. But in all these know, that
the fire of Nature is but one, and if it works variously,
it is by reason of the difference of places. The
vessell therefore of Nature is but one; but wee for
brevities sake use a couple: the matter is one, but out
of two substances. If therefore thou wilt give thy
mind to make things, consider first things that are already
made; if thou canst not reach, or understand
things presented to thy eyes, much lesse things that
are to be made, and which thou desirest to make.
For know that thou canst create nothing, for that is
proper to God alone, but to make things, that are not
perceived, but lye hid in the shadow, to appear, and
to take from them their vaile, is granted to an intelligent
Philosopher by God through Nature. Consider,
I beseech thee, the simple water of a cloud: who
would ever beleeve that that contains in it selfe all
things in the world, hard Stones, Salts, Aire, Earth,
Fire, when as yet of it selfe it seems to be simple?
What shall I say of the Earth, which contains in it
Water, Fire, Salts, Aire, and of it self seems to be
but meer earth? O wonderfull Nature, which knows
how to produce wonderfull fruits out of Water in the
earth, and from the Aire to give them life. All these
are done, and the eyes of the vulgar doe not see
them; but the eyes of the understanding, and imagination
perceive them, and that with a true sight. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
eyes of the wise look upon Nature otherwise, then
the eyes of common men. As for example, the eyes
of the vulgar see that the sun is hot; but the eyes
of Philosophers on the contrary see it rather to bee
cold, but its motion to be hot. The acts and effects
of it are understood through the distance of places.
The fire of Nature is one and the same with it: for as,
the Sun is the Center amongst the spheres of the
Planets; and out of this Center of the heaven it
scatters its heat downward by its motion; so in the
Center of the earth is the sun of the earth, which by
its perpetuall motion sends its heat, or beams upward
to the superficies of the earth. That intrinsecall
heat is far more efficacious then this Elementary
fire; but it is allayed with an Earthy water, which
from day to day doth penetrate the pores of the
earth, and cooles it: So the Aire doth temper,
and mitigate the heavenly Sun, and its heat, for this
aire doth day after day fly round the world: and unlesse
this were so, all things would be consumed by
so great a heat, neither would any thing be brought
forth. For as that invisible fire, or Centrall heat
would consume all things, if the water coming betwixt
did not prevent it; so the heat of the Sun would
destroy all things; if the Aire did not come betwixt.
But how these Elements work one with another, I
will briefly declare. In the Center of the earth is
the Centrall Sun, which by its own motion, or of its
firmament doth give a great heat, which extends it
self even to the superficies of the earth. That heate
causeth aire after this manner. The Matrix of aire
is water, which bringeth forth sons of its own nature,
but unlike, and far more subtill then it selfe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
for where the water is denyed entrance, the aire enters:
when therefore that Centrall heat, which is
perpetuall, doth act, it makes water distill, and be heated,
and so that water by reason of the heat is turned
into aire, upon this account it breaks forth to the
superficies of the earth, because it will not suffer it
self to be shut in: then when it is cold, it is resolved
into water. In the mean time it happens also that in
opposite places not only air but water goes out; so
you see it is, when black clouds are by violence carried
up into the aire: for which thing take this as a
familiar example. Make water hot in a pot, and
thou shalt see that a soft fire causeth gentle vapours,
and winds; but a strong fire maketh thick clouds appear.
Just in the same manner doth the Centrall
heat worke; it lifts up the subtill water into aire, that
which is thick by reason of its salt or fatnesse, it distributes
to the earth, by meanes of which divers
things are generated, that which remaines becomes
stones, and rocks. But some may object, if it were so,
it would be done constantly, but oftentimes there is
no wind at all perceived. I answer, if water be not
poured violently into a distillatory vessell, there is
made no wind, for little water stirs up but little wind:
you see that thunders are not alwaies made, although
there be rain, and wind; but only when by force of
the aire the swelling water is carried to the sphere of
the fire; for fire will not indure water. Thou hast before
thine eyes an example, when thou pourest cold
water into a hot furnace, from whence a thundering
noise is raised. But why the water doth not enter
uniformly into those places, and cavities, the reason
is, because these sorts of vessells, and places are ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>ny;
and sometimes one cavity by blasts, or winds
drives away from it self water for some dayes, and
months, untill there be a repercussion of the water again:
As wee see in the sea, whose waves are moved
and carryed a thousand miles, before they find, or
meet with a repercussion to make them return back;
but to return to our purpose. I say that Fire, or
Heat is the cause of the motion of the Aire, and the
life of all things; and the Earth is the Nurse of all
these things, or their receptacle. But if there were
not Water to coole our Earth, and Aire, then the
Earth would be dryed, for these two reasons, <i>viz.</i>
by reason of the Motion of the Centrall Sun, and
heat of the Celestiall: Neverthelesse it happens
sometimes in some places, when the pores of the
earth are obstructed, that the humidity, or water cannot
penetrate, that then by reason of the correspondency
of the Celestiall, and Centrall Sun (for they
have a magnetick vertue betwixt themselves) the
earth is inflamed by the Sun: so that even sometimes
there are made great chops, or furrows in the earth.
Cause therefore that there be such an operation in
our earth, that the Centrall heat may change the
Water into Aire, that it may goe forth into the
plaines of the world, and scatter the residue, as I
said, through the pores of the earth; and then contrariwise
the Aire will be turned into Water, far more
subtill then the first Water was: and this is done
thus, if thou givest our old man Gold, or Silver to
swallow, that he may consume them, and then hee
also dying may be burnt, and his ashes scattered into
water, and thou boil that water untill it be enough,
and thou shalt have a medicine to cure the lepro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>sie.
Mark, and be sure that thou takest not cold for
hot, or hot for cold, but mixe natures with natures,
and if there be any thing that is contrary to nature
(for Nature alone is necessary for thee) separate it,
that Nature may be like Nature. Doe this by fire,
and not with thy hand: and know that if thou dost
not follow Nature, all is in vain: and here I have spoken
to thee through the help of God, what a father
should speak to his son; Hee which hath ears let him
heare, and he which hath his senses, let him set his
mind upon what I say.</p>

<i>THE TWELFTH TREATISE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Stone, and its vertue.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_036_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>n the foregoing Treatises it hath been
sufficiently spoken concerning the production
of Naturall things, concerning
the Elements, the First matter, and Second
matter, Bodies, Seeds, and concerning the
Use and Vertue of them: I wrote also the Praxis
of making the Philosophers Stone. Now I will
discover so much of the vertue of it, as Nature hath
granted to me, and experience taught me. But to
comprehend the argument of all these Treatises
briefly, and in few words, that the Reader which fears
God may understand my mind and meaning, the
thing is this. If any man doubt of the truth of the
Art, let him read the voluminous writings of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span><span class="correction" title="In the original book: ancicient">ancient</span>
Philosophers, verified by reason, and experience;
whom wee may deservedly give credit to in
their own Art: but if any will not give credit to
them, then we know not how to dispute with them,
as denying principles: for deaf, and dumbe men
cannot speak. What prerogative should all things
in this world have before Metalls? Why should
these alone by having seed without cause denyed to
them, be excluded from Gods universall blessing of
multiplication, which holy writ affirms was put in,
and bestowed on all created things presently after the
world was made? Now if they have Seed, who is so
sottish to think that they cannot bee multiplyed in
their Seed? The Art of Alchymie in its kind is
true, Nature also is true, but the Artificer is seldome
true: there is one Nature, one Art, but many Artificers.
Now what things Nature makes out of
the Elements, she generates them by the will of
God out of the first matter, which God onely
knowes: Nature makes and multiplies those
things of the second matter, which the Philosophers
know. Nothing is done in the world without
the pleasure of God, and Nature. Every Element
is in its own sphere; but one cannot be without the
other; one lives by vertue of the other, and
yet being joined together they doe not agree; but
Water is of more worth then all the Elements, because
it is the mother of all things: upon this
swims the spirit of Fire. By reason of Fire Water is
the first matter, <i>viz.</i> by the striving together of
Fire, and Water, and so are generated Winds, and
Vapours apt, and easy to bee congealed with the
earth, by the help of the crude aire, which from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
beginning was separated from it. And this is done
without cessation, by a perpetuall motion; because
fire, or heat is stirred up no otherwise then by motion,
which thing you may easily conceive by a
Smith filing Iron, which through vehement motion
waxeth hot in that manner, as if it were heated
in the Fire. Motion therefore causeth heat, heat
moves the water, the motion of the water causeth
aire, the life of all living things. Things therefore
grow after this manner (as I said before) <i>viz.</i> out
of water; for out of the subtill Vapour of it, subtil
and light things proceed; out of the oylinesse of it,
things that are heavy, and of greater price; but of
the salt things far more excellent then the former.
Now because Nature is sometimes hindred, that
it cannot produce pure things; seeing the Vapour,
Fatnesse, and Salt are fouled or stained, and mixe
themselves with the places of the earth: Moreover,
experience teacheth us to separate the pure from the
impure. Therefore if thou wilt have Nature be bettered,
or mended in her actings, dissolve what body
you please, and that which was added or joined to
Nature, as heterogeneous, separate, cleanse, joine
pure things with pure, ripe to ripe, crude to crude,
according to the poise of Nature, and not of Matter.
And know that the Centrall salt Nitre doth
not receive more of the Earth then it hath need of,
whether it be pure or impure: but the fatnesse of the
water is otherwise, for it is never to be had pure; art
purifies it by a twofold heat, and then conjoins it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;wrote the Twelve foregoing Treatises
in love to the sonnes of Art, that before
they set their hand to the worke they
may know the operation of Nature,
<i>viz.</i> how she produceth things by her working; lest
they should attempt to enter in at the gate without
keyes, or to draw water in a sieve: for he laboureth
in vain, that putteth forth his hands to labour without
the knowledge of Nature, in this sacred and
most true Art, he lies in nocturnal darknesse to whom
the sun doth not shine, and he is in thick darknesse, to
whom after it is night the Moon doth not appeare.
Nature hath her proper light, which is not obvious
to our eyes; the shadow of Nature is a body before
our eyes: but if the light of Nature doth enlighten
any one, presently the cloud is taken away from before
his eyes, and without any let he can behold the
point of our loadstone, answering to each Center of
the beams, <i>viz.</i> of the Sun and Earth: for so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>re
doth the light of Nature penetrate, and discovers
inward things; of which thing take this for an example.
Let a boy that is twelve yeares old, and a girle
of the same age, be cloathed with garments of the
same fashion, and be set one by the other, no body
can know which is the male, or which is the female;
our eyes cannot penetrate so far, therefore our sight
deceiveth us, and takes false things for true: But
when their garments are taken off, and they are
naked, that so it may appear what Nature made
them, they are easily distinguished by their sexes.
Just after the same manner doth our intellect make a
shadow of the shadow of Nature; for the naked body
of Man is the shadow of the seed of Nature: As
therefore mans body is covered with a garment, so
also mans nature is covered with the body, which
God reserves to himself to cover, or uncover. I could
here discourse largely, and Philosophically of the dignity
of Man, his Creation and Generation: but seeing
they are impertinent to this place, I will passe
them over in silence; only I will treat a little concerning
the Life of Man. Man was created of the
Earth, and lives by vertue of the Aire; for there is
in the Aire a secret food of life, which in the night
wee call dew; and in the day rarified water, whose
invisible, congealed spirit is better then the whole
Earth. O holy, and wonderfull Nature, who
dost not suffer the sons of Wisdome to erre, as thou
dost manifest in the life of man daily! Moreover in
these twelve Treatises I have produced so many
naturall reasons, that he which is desirous of the
art, and feares God, may the more easily understand
all things, which through Gods blessing, with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
eyes I have seen, with mine own hands have made
without any deceit of sophistication: for without the
light, and knowledge of Nature, it is impossible
to attain to this Art, unlesse it come to any by
Gods speciall revelation, or some speciall friend doth
privately shew it. It is a thing of little account, yet
most pretious, which being divers times described, I
doe now again repeat. Take 10 parts of aire, 1 part
of living gold, or living silver; put all these into
thy vessel; boyle this aire first untill it be water, and
then no water. If thou art ignorant of this, and
knowst not how to boyl aire, without all doubt thou
shalt erre; seeing this is the matter of the ancient
Philosophers. For thou must take that, which is,
and is not seen, untill it be the Artificers pleasure; it
is the water of our dew, out of which is extracted the
Salt Petre of Philosophers, by which all things
grow, and are nourished: the matrix of it is the
Center of the Sun, and Moon, both celestiall, and
terrestiall: and to speak more plainly, it is our Loadstone,
which in the foregoing Treatises I called Chalybs,
or Steel: The Aire generates this Loadstone,
and the Loadstone generates, or makes our Air to appear,
and come forth. I have here entirely shewed thee
the truth; Begge of God that hee would prosper
thine undertakings: And so in this place thou shalt
have the true, and right explication of <i>Hermes</i>, when
he saith, that the father of it is the Sun, and its mother
the Moon, and that which the wind carryed in its
belly, <i>viz.</i> <i>Sal Alkali</i>, which the Philosophers have
called <i>Sal Armoniacum</i>, and vegetable, hid in the belly
of the <i>Magnesia</i>. The operation of it is this, to dissolve
the congealed aire, in which thou shall dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
the tenth part of Gold; seale this up, and work with
our fire, untill the air be turned into powders; and
there appear (the salt of the world being first had) divers
colours. I would have set down the whole processe
in these Treatises; but because that, together
with the multiplication, is sufficiently set down in
the books of <i>Lullius</i>, and other old Philosophers;
it therefore sufficed me to treat only of the first, and
second matter; which is done faithfully, neither do
thou ever think that any man living hath done it more
cleerly, then I have done it; since I have done it not
out of many books but by the labour of my hands,
and mine own experience. If therefore thou dost
not understand, or beleeve the truth, doe not blame
me, but thy self; and perswade thy selfe that God
was unwilling to reveal this secret to thee: Be therefore
earnest with him by prayer, and with serious
meditation read over this book oftentimes, especially
the Epilogue of these twelve Treatises: alwaies considering
the possibility of Nature, and the actions of
the Elements, and which of them is the chiefest in
those actions, and especially in the rarefaction of
water, or aire, for so the heavens are created, as also
the whole world. This I was willing to signifie
to thee, as a father to his son. Doe not wonder
that I have wrote so many Treatises, for I did not
make them for my own sake, seeing I lack not books,
but that I might advertise many, that work in fruitlesse
things, that they should not spend their costs
in vain. All things indeed might have been comprehended
in few lines, yea in few words: but I was
willing to guide thee to the knowledge of Nature by
Reasons, and Examples; that thou mightest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
first place know, what the thing is thou seekest after,
whether the first, or second matter, also that thou
mightest have Nature, her light, &amp; shadow discovered
to thee. Be not displeased if thou meetest sometimes
with contradictions in my Treatises, it being the
custome of Philosophers to use them; thou hast
need of them, if thou understandest them, thou
shall not find a rose without prickles. Weigh diligently
what I have said before, <i>viz.</i> how four Elements
distill into the Center of the earth a radicall
moisture, and how the Centrall Sun of the earth, by
its motion bringeth it forth, and sublimeth it to the
superficies of the earth. I have said also that the Celestiall
Sun hath a correspondency with the Centrall
Sun: for the Celestiall Sun, and the Moon have a
peculiar power, and vertue of distilling into the earth
by vertue of their beams: for heat is easily joined to
heat, and salt to salt. And as the Centrall Sun hath
its sea, and crude water, that is perceptible; so the
Celestiall Sun hath its sea, and subtill water that is
not perceptible. In the superficies the beams of the
one, are joined to the beams of the other, and produce
flowers, and all things. Therefore when there is
raine made, it receives from the aire that power of
life, and joins it with the salt-nitre of the earth (because
the salt-nitre of the earth is like calcined Tartar,
drawing to it self by reason of its drynesse the
aire, which in it is resolved into water: such attractive
power hath the salt-nitre of the earth, which also was
aire, and is joined to the fatnesse of the earth) and
by how much the more abundantly the beams of the
Sun beat upon it, the greater quantity of salt-nitre is
made, and by consequence the greater plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
Corn grows, and is increased, and this is done daily.
Thus much I thought good to signifie to the ignorant
of the correspondency, or agreement of things
amongst themselves, and the efficacy of the Sun, and
Moon, and Stars; for the wise need not this instruction.
Our subject is presented to the eyes of the
whole world, and it is not known. O our Heaven!
O our Water! O our Mercury! O our Salt-nitre abiding
in the sea of the world! O our Vegetable! O
our Sulphur fixed, and volatill! O our <i>Caput Mortuum</i>,
or dead head, or feces of our Sea! Our Water
that wets not our hands, without which no mortall
can live, and without which nothing grows,
or is generated in the whole world! And these are
the Epithites of <i>Hermes</i> his bird, which never is at
rest. It is of very small account, yet no body can bee
without it: and so thou hast a thing discovered to
thee more pretious then the whole world, which I
plainly tell thee is nothing else but our Sea water,
which is congealed in Silver, and Gold, and extracted
out of Gold, and Silver by the help of our Chalybs,
by the Art of Philosophers in a wonderfull manner,
by a prudent son of Art. It was not my purpose
for some reasons before mentioned in the Preface,
to publish this book, but a desire to deserve well
of those that are studiously given to liberall, and Philosophical
Arts, prevailed with me, that I might hold
forth to them, that I bear an honest mind; also that I
might declare my self to them, that understand the
Art, to be their equal and fellow, and to have attained
their knowledge. I doubt not but many men of
good consciences, and affections do enjoy this gift of
God secretly; these being warned by my example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
and dangers are made more cautious, and wise, having
that commendable silence of <i>Harpocrates</i>. For as often
as I would discover my selfe to great men, it
alwaies turned to my losse and danger. By this my
writing I make my self known to the adopted sons of
<i>Hermes</i>, I instruct the ignorant, and them that are
misled, and bring them back into the right way. And
let the heirs of wisdome know, that they shall never
have a better way, then that, which is here demonstrated
to them; for I have spoken all things cleerly:
Only I have not so cleerly shewed the extraction
of our Salt Armoniacke, or the Mercury of Philosophers,
out of our Sea water, and the use thereof,
because I had from the Master of Nature no leave
to speake any further, and this only God must
reveale, who knows the hearts, and minds of men.
He will haply upon thy constant, and earnest prayers,
and the frequent reading over of this booke,
open the eyes of thy understanding. The vessell, as
I said before, is but one from the beginning to the
end, or at most two are sufficient: the fire is continuall
in both operations; for the sake of which let the ignorant
read the tenth, and eleventh Treatise. If thou
shalt operate in a third matter, thou shalt effect
nothing: they medle with this, whoever work
not in our Salt, which is Mercury, but in Herbs,
Animals, Stones, and all Minerals, excepting our
Gold, and Silver covered over with the sphere of
<i>Saturne</i>. And whosoever desires to attaine to
his desired end, let him understand the conversion
of the Elements to make light things heavy,
and to make spirits no spirits; then hee shall
not worke in a strange thing. The Fire is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
Rule, whatsoever is done, is done by Fire; as
sufficiently before, so here we have spoken enough
by way of Conclusion. Farewell friendly Reader!
and long maist thou enjoy these labours of mine,
(made good, or verified by mine owne experience,)
to the glory of God, the welfare of thine
owne soule, and good of thy neighbour.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/b_047_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;have now opened to you all things from
the very first rising of the universall fountaine,
that there is no more left to be discovered.
For in the foregoing Treatises I
have sufficiently explained Nature by way of example:
I have shewed the Theorie and Praxis, as
plainely as it was lawfull. But lest any should
complain of my briefnesse, that by reason of it I
have omitted something, I will yet further describe
to thee the whole Art by way of Ridle, or Ænigmaticall
speech; that thou maist see how farre through
Gods guidance I am come. The bookes that treat
of this Art are infinite; yet thou shalt not find in
any of them the truth so much, as it is in this of
mine, made known, or discovered unto thee. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
reason that encouraged mee to make it so plain, was
this, <i>viz.</i> Because, when I had discoursed with many
men, that thought they understood the writings of
Philosophers very well; I perceived that they did explaine
those writings far more subtilly then Nature,
which is simple and plain, did require: yea all my true
sayings did seem to them being profoundly wise, or
savouring of high things, to bee of no value and
incredible. It hapned sometimes that I would intimate
the Art to some from word to word, but they
could by no meanes understand mee, not beleeving
there was any water in our Sea, and yet they would
be accounted Philosophers. Since therefore they
could not understand my words, which I delivered
by word of mouth, I doe not fear (as other Philosophers
were afraid) that any one can so easily understand
what I have wrote; It is the gift, I say, of God.
It is true indeed, if in the study of Alchymie
there were required subtilnesse, and quicknesse of
wit, and things were of that Nature as to be perceived
by the eyes of the vulgar, I saw that their fancies,
or wits were apt enough to find out such things: but
I say to you, bee simple, or plaine, and not too wise
untill you have found out the secret, which when you
have, it will of necessity require wisdome enough to
use, and keep it; then it will be easy for you to write
many books; because it is easier for him, that is in
the Center, and sees the thing, then for him that
walks in the Circumference, and only heares of it.
You have the second matter of all things most
cleerly described unto you: but let mee give you this
Caution, that if you would attaine to this secret,
know that first of all God is to bee prayed to, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
your neighbour is to bee loved: and lastly, doe not
fancy to your selves things that are subtill, which
Nature knew nothing of; but abide, I say, abide in
the plain way of Nature; because you may sooner
feel the thing in plainnesse, or simplicity, then see it
in subtilty. In reading therefore my writings doe
not stick in the letter of them, but in reading of
them consider Nature, and the possibility thereof.
Now before you set your selves to work, consider diligently
what it is you seek, and what the scope, and
end of your intention is: for it is much better to
learn by the brain, and imagination, then with labour,
and charges. And this I say to you, that
you must seek for some hidden thing, out of which is
made (after a wonderfull manner) such a moisture,
or humidity, which doth dissolve Gold without violence,
or noise, yea so sweetly, and naturally, as ice
doth melt in warme water: if you find out this, you
have that thing, out of which Gold is produced by
Nature: and although all Metalls, and all things
have their originall from hence, yet nothing is so
friendly to it as Gold; for to other things there
sticks fast some impurity, but to Gold none, besides
it is like a Mother unto it. And so finally I conclude;
if you will not be wise, and wary by these
my writings, and admonitions, yet excuse mee who
desire to deserve well of you: I have dealt as faithfully
as it was lawfull for mee, and as becomes a man
of a good conscience to doe. If you ask who I am,
I am one that can live any where: if you know mee,
and desire to shew your selves good and honest men,
you shall hold your tongue: if you know mee not,
doe not enquire after mee, for I will reveale to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
mortall man, whilest I live, more then I have done
in this publick writing. Beleeve mee, if I were not
a man of that ranke and condition as I am, nothing
would be more pleasant to mee then a solitary life,
or with <i>Diogenes</i> to lie hid under a tub: for I see all
things that are to be but vanity, and that deceit, and
covetousnesse are altogether in use, where all things
are to be sold, and that vice doth excell vertue. I see
the better things of the life to come before mine eys.
I rejoice in these. Now I doe not wonder, as before I
did, why Philosophers, when they have attained to
this Medicine, have not cared to have their dayes
shortned; because every Philosopher hath the life to
come set so cleerly before his eyes, as thy face is seen
in a glasse. And if God shall graunt thee thy desired
end, then thou shalt beleeve mee, and not reveal
thy self to the world.</p>

<p>t fell out upon a time, when I had
sailed almost all my life from the Artick
pole, to the Antarticke, that by the
singular providence of God I was cast
upon the shore of a certain great sea, and
although I well knew and understood the passages,
and properties of the sea of that Coast, yet I knew
not whether in those Coasts was bred that little fish,
which was called <i>Remora</i>, which so many men of
great and small fortunes have hitherto so studiously
sought after. But whilst I was beholding the sweet
singing Mermaides swimming up and down with the
Nymphs, and being weary with my foregoing labors,
and oppressed with divers thoughts, I was with the
noise of waters overtaken with sleep; and whilest I
was in a sweet sleep, there appear’d to me in my sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
a wonderfull vision, which is this. I saw <i>Neptune</i>
a man of an honorable old age, going forth out of
our sea with his three toothed instrument, called <i>Tridens</i>,
who after a friendly salute led mee into a most
pleasant Iland. This goodly Iland was situated
towards the South, being replenished with all things
respecting the necessity, and delight of man: <i>Virgils
Elisian</i> field might scarce compare with it. All the
banks were round about beset with green Mirtles,
Cypresse trees, and Rosemary. The green meadowes
were covered all over with flowers of all sorts, both
fair, and sweet. The hills were set forth with Vines,
Olive trees, and Cedar-trees in a most wonderfull
manner. The woods were filled with Orenge, and
Lemon-trees. The high wayes were planted on both
sides with Bay-trees, and Pomegranate-trees, woven
most artificially one within the other, and affording
a most pleasant shadow to Travellers. And to bee
short, whatsoever is in the whole world was seen
there. As I was walking, there was shewed to me
by the foresaid <i>Neptune</i> two Mines of that Iland lying
under a certain rock, the one was of Gold, the
other of Chalybs, or Steel. Not far from thence I
was brought to a Meadow in which was a peculiar
Orchard with divers sorts of trees most goodly to behold,
and amongst the rest, being very many hee
shewed to mee seven Trees marked out by speciall
names; and amongst these I observed two as chiefest,
more eminent then the rest, one of which did beare
fruit like the Sun most bright, and shining, and the
leaves thereof were like Gold. The other brought
forth fruit that was most white, yea, whiter then the
Lillies, and the leaves therof were as fine Silver: Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
these trees were called by <i>Neptune</i>, the one the tree of
the Sun, the other the tree of the Moon. And although
in this Iland all things were at ones pleasure, and
command, yet there was one thing, and but one wanting:
there was no water to be had, but with great
difficulty. There were indeed many that partly endeavoured
to bring it thither by pipes, and partly
drew it out of divers things: but their endeavours
were in vain, because in those places it could not bee
had by any means or medium; and if it were at any
time had, yet it was unprofitable, and poisonous, unlesse
they fetched it (as few could doe) from the
beams of the Sun, and Moone; and he which was
fortunate in so doing could never get above ten parts;
and that water was most wonderfull: and beleeve
mee, for I saw it with mine eyes, and felt it, that that
water was as white as the snow; and whilest I was
contemplating upon the water, I was in a great wonder.
Wherefore <i>Neptune</i> being in the mean while
wearied vanished away from before mine eyes, and
there appeared to me a great man, upon whose forehead
was written the name of <i>Saturne</i>. This man
taking the vessell drew ten parts of water; and tooke
presently of the tree of the Sun, and put it in; and I
saw the fruit of the tree consumed, and resolved like
ice in warm water. I demanded of him; Sir, I see a
wonderfull thing, water to bee as it were of nothing;
I see the fruit of the tree consumed in it with a most
sweet, and kindly heat, and wherefore is all this? But
he answered mee most lovingly. My Son, it is true
this is a thing to be wondered at; but doe not thou
wonder at it, for so it must be. For this water is the
Water of life, having power to better the fruit of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
tree so, that afterward neither by planting, or graffing,
but only by its own odour it may convert the other
six trees into its own likenesse. Moreover this water
is to this fruit as it were a woman, the fruit of this
tree can be putrefied in nothing but in this water, and
although the fruit of it be of it self most wonderful, &amp;
a thing of great price; yet if it be putrefied in this water,
it begets by this putrefaction a <i>Salamander</i>, abiding
in the fire, whose blood is more pretious then any
kind of treasure or riches in the world, being able to
make those six trees, which here thou seest, fruitfull,
and to bring forth their fruit sweeter then the honey.
But I asked, Sir, How is that done? I told thee (saith
hee) that the fruit of that tree is living, and sweet;
but whereas one is now sufficed with it, when it is
boyled in this water, a thousand may then bee
satisfied with it. I demanded moreover, Sir, is
it boiled with a strong fire, and how long is it
in boyling? But said he, that water hath an intrinsecall
fire, and if it be helped with a continuall heat, it
burns three parts of its body with this body of the
fruit, and there wil remain but a very smal part, which
is scarce imaginable, but of wonderful vertue; it is boiled
by the skilfull wit of the Artificer, first 7 months,
then 10, but in the mean time there appeared divers
things, and alwaies in the fiftieth day, or thereabouts.
I demanded again, Sir, cannot this fruit be boiled in
other waters, or something be put to it? Hee answered,
there is but this one water that is usefull in
this Country, or Island; and there is no other water
can penetrate the pores of this apple, but this: and
know also that the Tree of the Sun hath its originall
from this water, which is extracted out of the beams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
of the Sun, and Moone by a magnetick vertue: Besides
they have a great correspondency betwixt themselves,
but if any strange thing be added to it, it cannot
performe that which it can do of it self. It must
therefore be left by it self, and nothing added to it but
this apple: This fruit after boiling becomes to bee
immortall, having life, and blood, which blood makes
all the trees bring forth fruit of the same nature with
the Apple. I asked him further, Sir, is this Water
drawn any other way, or to be had every where? And
he said, it is in every place, and no man can live without
it; it is drawn divers ways, but that is the best,
which is extracted by vertue of our Chalybs, which is
found in the belly of <i>Aries</i>. I said, to what use is it?
He answered, before its due boiling it is the greatest
poison, but after a convenient boiling it is the greatest
medicine, and yeelds nine and twenty graines of
blood; and every grain will yeeld to thee the fruit of
the Tree of the Sun in 864 fold. I asked, Can it not
be made yet better? The Philosophicall Scripture
being witnesse (saith hee) it may bee exalted first to
ten, then to a hundred, then to a thousand, and ten
thousand. I required again of him, Sir, Doe many
know that Water, and hath it any proper name? He
cryed out saying, Few know it, but all have
seen it, and doe see it, and love it: it hath many and
various names, but its proper name is the Water of
our Sea, the Water of life not wetting the hands. I
asked yet further, Doe any use it to any other things?
Every creature (saith he) doth use it, but invisibly.
Then I asked, Doth any thing grow in it? but he said,
Of it are made all things in the world, and in it they
live: but in it nothing properly is, but it is that thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
which mixeth it self to every thing. I asked againe, Is
it usefull for any thing without the fruit of this tree?
To this he said, Not in this work; because it is not
bettered, but in the fruit of the Tree of the Sun alone.
I began to intreat him, Sir I pray, name it to mee by
such a manifest name, that I may have no further
doubt about it. But he cryed with a loud voice, so as
that he awakened me from sleep; Therefore I could
ask him no further, neither would hee tell mee any
more, neither can I tell any more. Be satisfied with
these, and beleeve mee, that it is not possible to speak
more cleerly. For if thou dost not understand these
things, thou wilt never be able to comprehend the
books of other Philosophers. After <i>Saturn</i>’s unexpected
and sudden departure a new sleep came upon
mee, and then appeared to mee <i>Neptune</i> in a visible
shape: He congratulated my present happinesse in the
gardens of the <i>Hesperides</i>, shewing to me a Looking-glasse,
in which I saw all Nature discovered. After
the changing of divers words betwixt us, I gave him
thanks for his courtesies shewed to me; because I not
only entred into this garden, but also came into <i>Saturn</i>’s
most desired discourse. But because by reason
of <i>Saturn</i>’s unexpected departure some difficulties
did yet remain to be inquired after, and searched into,
I earnestly besought him, that by means of this happy
opportunity hee would resolve mee my doubts.
Now I importuned him with these words, Sir <i>I</i> have
read the books of Philosophers, and they say, that all
generation is done by Male, and Female, yet I saw in
my dream <i>Saturne</i> put the fruit alone of the Tree of
the Sun into our Mercury; I beleeve also thee as the
Master of this Sea, that thou knowest these things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
answer my Question I pray thee. But he said, It is true,
my son, all generation is done in Male, and Female,
but by reason of the distinguishing of the three Kingdomes
of Nature, a foure footed Animall is brought
forth one way, and a worme another: Although
wormes have eyes, sight, hearing, and other senses, yet
they are brought forth by putrefaction, and their
place, or earth, in which they are putrefied, is the
Female. So in this Philosophicall work the mother of
this thing is that Water of thine so often repeated, &amp;
whatsoever is produced of that, is produced as worms
by putrefaction. Therfore the Philosophers have created
a Phenix, &amp; Salamander. For if it were done by the
conception of two bodies, it would be a thing subject
to death; but because it revives it self alone, the former
body being destroyed, it riseth up another body incorruptible.
Seeing the death of things is nothing else but
the separation of the one from the other. And so it is
in this Phenix, because the life separates it self by its
self from a corruptible body. Moreover, I asked him,
Sir, are there divers things, or is there a composition
of things in this work? But he said, there is only one
thing, with which there is mixed nothing else but the
Philosophicall Water shewed to thee oftentimes in
thy sleep, of which there must be ten parts to one of
the body. And strongly, and undoubtedly beleeve,
My son, that those things which are by me and <i>Saturn</i>
shewed thee by way of dreams, according to the custom,
in this Iland, are not dreams, but the very truth,
which Experience the only Mistris of things will by
the assistance of God discover to thee. I yet further
demanded some things of him, but hee without any
answer, after he had took his leave of mee, departing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
set me, being raised from sleep, into my desired region
of <i>Europe</i>. And so friendly Reader, let this suffice
thee, which hath by mee thus farre been fully declared.</p>

<p>pon a time there were assembled divers
<i>Alchymists</i> together, and held a counsel
how they should make, &amp; prepare the
Philosophers stone, and they concluded
that every one should declare his opinion
with a vow. And that meeting was in the open aire,
in a certaine meadow, on a faire cleer day. And many
agreed that Mercury was the first matter thereof, others
that Sulphur was, and others other things.
But the chiefest opinion was of Mercury, and that
especially because of the sayings of Philosophers, because
they hold, that Mercury is the first true matter
of the Stone, also of Metalls: For Philosophers cry
out, and say, OUR MERCURY, &amp;c. And
so whilest they did contend amongst themselves for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
divers operations (every one gladly expecting a conclusion)
there arose in the mean time a very great
tempest, with stormes, showers of rain, and an unheard
of wind, which dispersed that assembly into
divers Provinces, every one apart without a conclusion.
Yet every one of them fancied to himselfe
what the conclusion of that dispute should have been.
Every one therefore set upon his work as before, one
in this thing, another in that thing seeking the Philosophers
Stone, and this is done till this day without
any giving over. Now one of them remembring the
disputation, that the Philosophers Stone is necessarily
to be sought after in Mercury, said to himself: Although
there was no conclusion made, yet I wil work
in Mercury, and will make a conclusion my self in making
the blessed Stone; for he was a man that was alwaies
wont to talk to himselfe, as indeed all <i>Alchymists</i>
usually doe. Hee therefore began to read the
books of Philosophers, and fell upon a booke of <i>Alanus</i>,
which treats of Mercury; and so that Alchymist
is made a Philosopher, but without any conclusion:
And taking Mercury he began to work; hee
put it into a glass, and put fire to it, the Mercury as it is
wont to do, vapoured away, the poor silly Alchymist
not knowing the nature of it, beat his wife, saying: No
body could come hither besides thee, thou tookest
the Mercury out of the glass. His wife crying excuseth
her self, and speaks softly to her husband: Thou wilt
make a sir-reverence of these. The Alchymist tooke
Mercury again, and put it again into his vessell, and
lest his wife should take it away, watched it. But the
Mercury, as its manner is, vapoured away again. The
Alchymist remembring that the first matter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
Philosophers Stone must be volatile, rejoiced exceedingly,
altogether perswading himselfe that he could
not now be deceived, having the first matter: Hee
began now to work upon Mercury boldly, he learned
afterwards to sublime it, and to calcine it divers ways,
as with Salt, Sulphur, and Metalls, Mineralls, Bloud,
Haire, Corrosive waters, Herbs, Urine, Vineger,
but could find nothing for his purpose; hee left nothing
unassayed in the whole world, with which hee
did not work upon good Mercury withall. But when
he could doe no good at all with this, hee fell upon
this saying&mdash;&mdash;<i>that it is found in the dung-hill</i>. He
began to worke upon Mercury with divers sorts of
dung, together, and asunder: And when hee was
weary, and full of thoughts he fell into a sleep. And
in his sleep there appeared to him a vision: there
came to him an old man, who saluted him, and said;
Friend, Why art thou sad? Hee answered, I would
willingly make the Philosophers Stone. Then said
he, Friend, Of what wilt thou make the Philosophers
Stone? <i>Alchymista.</i> Of Mercury, Sir. <i>Senex.</i> Of
what Mercury? <i>Alch.</i> There is but one Mercury.
<i>Sen.</i> It is true, there is but one Mercury, but altered
variously, according to the variety of places; one
is purer then another. <i>Alch.</i> O Sir, I know how to
purifie it very well with vineger and salt, with nitre
and vitriall. <i>Sen.</i> I tell thee this is not the true purifying
of it, neither is this, thus purifyed, the true
Mercury: Wise men have another Mercury, and
another manner of purifying of it, and so he vanished
away. The Alchymist being raised from sleep thought
with himselfe what vision this should be, as also what
this Mercury of Philosophers should be: hee could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
bethinke himselfe of no other but the vulgar Mercury.
But yet hee desired much that hee might have
had a longer discourse with the old man: but yet hee
worked continually, sometimes in the dung of living
creatures, as boyes dung, and sometimes in his own.
And every day hee went to the place, where hee saw
the vision, that he might speak with the old man again:
sometimes hee counterfeited a sleep, and lay
with his eyes shut expecting the old man. But when
he would not come he thought he was afraid of him,
and would not beleeve that he was asleep, he swore
therefore saying, My good old Master be not afraid,
for truly I am asleep; look upon my eyes, see if I be
not: And the poor Alchymist after so many labours,
and the spending of all his goods, now at last fel mad,
by alwaies thinking of the old man. And when hee
was in that strong imagination, there appeared to him
in his sleep a false vision, in the likenesse of the old
man, and said to him, Doe not despaire, my friend,
thy Mercury is good, and thy matter, but if it will
not obey thee, conjure it, that it bee not volatile; Serpents
are used to be conjured, and then why not Mercury?
and so the old man would leave him. But the
Alchymist asked of him, saying, Sir, expect, &amp;c. And
by reason of a noise this poore Alchymist was raised
from sleep, yet not without great comfort. He took
then a vessell full of Mercury, and began to conjure
it divers wayes, as his dream taught him. And hee remembred
the words of the old man, in that hee said,
<i>Serpents are conjured</i>, and Mercury is painted with
Serpents, hee thought, so it must bee conjured as the
Serpents. And taking a vessell with Mercury hee
began to say, <i>Ux, Vx, Ostas, &amp;c.</i> And where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
name of the Serpent should be put, he put the name
of Mercury, saying: And thou wicked beast Mercury,
&amp;c. At which words Mercury began to laugh, and
to speak unto him saying, What wilt thou have, that
thou thus troublest mee my Master Alchymist? <i>Alch.</i>
O ho, now thou callest me Master, when I touch thee
to the quick, now I have found where thy bridle is,
wait a little, and by and by thou shalt sing my song,
and he began to speak to him, as it were angerly, Art
thou that Mercury of Philosophers? <i>Merc.</i> (as if
he were afraid answered) I am Mercury, my Master.
<i>Alch.</i> Why therefore wilt not thou obey mee? and
why could not I fix thee? <i>Merc.</i> O my noble Master,
I beseech thee pardon mee, wretch that I am, I
did not know that thou wast so great a Philosopher.
<i>Alch.</i> Didst not thou perceive this by my operations,
seeing I proceeded so Philosophically with thee?
<i>Merc.</i> So it is, my noble Master, although I would
hide my selfe, yet I see I cannot from so honourable
a Master as thou art. <i>Alch.</i> Now therefore dost thou
know a Philosopher? <i>Merc.</i> Yea, my Master, I see
that your worship is a most excellent Philosopher.
<i>Alch.</i> (being glad at his heart saith) truly now I have
found what I sought for. (Again he spake to Mercury
with a most terrible voice:) Now go to, be now
therefore obedient, or else it shall be the worse for
thee. <i>Merc.</i> Willingly, my Master, if I am able, for
now I am very weake. <i>Alch.</i> Why dost thou now
excuse thy selfe? <i>Merc.</i> I doe not, my Master, but I
am faint and feeble. <i>Alch.</i> What hurts thee? <i>Merc.</i>
The Alchymist hurts mee. <i>Alch.</i> What, dost thou
still deride mee? <i>Merc.</i> O Master, no, I speak of the
Alchymist, but thou art a Philosopher. <i>Alch.</i> O wel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
well, that is true, but what hath the Alchymist done?
<i>Merc.</i> O my Master, hee hath done many evill
things to mee, for hee hath mixed mee, poor wretch
as I am, with things contrary to mee: from whence I
shall never bee able to recover my strength, and
I am almost dead, for I am tormented almost unto
death. <i>Alch.</i> O thou deservest those things, for thou
art disobedient. <i>Merc.</i> I was never disobedient to
any Philosopher, but it is naturall to mee to deride
fools. <i>Alch.</i> And what dost thou think of mee? <i>Merc.</i>
O Sir, you are a great man, a very great Philosopher,
yea greater then <i>Hermes</i> himselfe. <i>Alch.</i> Truly so
it is, I am a learned man, but I will not commend
my selfe, but my Wife also said to mee, that I am a
very learned Philosopher, she knew so much by me.
<i>Merc.</i> I am apt to beleeve thee, for Philosophers must
be so, who by reason of too much wisdome, and pains
fall mad. <i>Alch.</i> Goe to then, tell me therefore what
I shall doe with thee; how I shall make the Philosophers
Stone of thee. <i>Merc.</i> O my Master Philosopher,
I know not, Thou art a Philosopher, I am a servant
of the Philosophers, they make of me what they
please, I obey them as much as I am able. <i>Alch.</i> Thou
must tell mee how I must proceed with thee, and
how I may make of thee the Philosophers Stone.
<i>Merc.</i> If thou knowest, thou shall make it, but if
thou knowest not, thou shalt doe nothing, thou shalt
know nothing by mee, if thou knowest not already
my Master Philosopher. <i>Alch.</i> Thou speakest to
mee as to some simple man, perhaps thou dost not
know that I have worked with Princes, and was accounted
a Philosopher with them. <i>Merc.</i> I am apt to
beleeve thee my Master, for I know all this very wel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
I am yet foul, and unclean by reason of those mixtures
that thou hast used. <i>Alch.</i> Therefore tell mee,
art thou the Mercury of Philosophers? <i>Merc.</i> I am
Mercury, but whether or no the Philosophers, that
belongs to thee to know. <i>Alch.</i> Do but tell me if thou
art the true Mercury, or if there be another. <i>Merc.</i> I
am Mercury, but there is another, and so he vanished
away. The Alchymist cries out and speaks, but no
body answers him. And bethinking himselfe saith:
Surely I am an excellent man, Mercury hath been
pleased to talke with mee, surely hee loves mee: and
then he began to sublime Mercury, distil, calcine, make
Turbith of him, precipitate, and dissolve him divers
wayes, and with divers waters, but as hee laboured
in vain before, so now also he hath spent his time, and
costs to no purpose. Wherefore at last hee begins to
curse Mercury, and revile Nature because shee
made him. Now Nature when she heard these things
called Mercury to her, and said to him: What hast
thou done to this man? Why doth he curse and revile
me for thy sake? Why dost not thou doe what
thou oughtest to doe? But Mercury modestly excuseth
himself. Yet Nature commands him to be obedient
to the sons of Wisdome, that seek after him.
Mercury promiseth that he will, and saith: Mother
Nature, but who can satisfie fools? Nature went away
smiling: but Mercury being angry with the Alchymist
goes also unto his own place. After a few days
it came into the Alchymists mind, that he omitted
something in his operations, and again hee hath recourse
to Mercury, and now resolves to mix him with
hogs dung; but Mercury being angry that he had falsly
accused him before his mother Nature, saith to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
Alchymist, What wilt thou have of me thou foole?
Why hast thou thus accused mee? <i>Alch.</i> Art thou he
that <i>I</i> have longed to see? <i>Merc.</i> <i>I</i> am, but no man
that is blind can see mee. <i>Alch.</i> <i>I</i> am not blind.
<i>Merc.</i> Thou art very blind, for thou canst not see
thy selfe, how then canst thou see mee? <i>Alch.</i> O now
thou art proud, <i>I</i> speak civilly to thee, and thou contemnest
mee: thou dost not know perhaps that I
have worked with many Princes, and was esteemed
as a Philosopher amongst them. <i>Merc.</i> Fools flock
to Princes Courts, for there they are honoured, and
fare better then others. Wast thou also at the Court?
<i>Alch.</i> O thou art a devill, and not a good Mercury,
if thou wilt speak thus to Philosophers: for before
thou didst also seduce me thus. <i>Mer.</i> Dost thou know
Philosophers? <i>Alch.</i> I my self am a Philosopher.
<i>Merc.</i> Behold our Philosopher (smiling said: and
began to talke further with him saying) My Philosopher,
tell mee therefore what thou seekest after, and
what thou wilt have, what dost thou desire to make?
<i>Alch.</i> The Philosophers stone. <i>Merc.</i> Out of what
matter therefore wilt thou make it? <i>Alch.</i> Of our
Mercury. <i>Merc.</i> O my Philosopher, now I wil leave
you, for I am not yours. <i>Alch.</i> O thou art but a devill,
and wilt seduce mee. <i>Merc.</i> Truly my Philosopher
thou art a devill to mee, not I to thee: for thou
dost deale most sordidly with mee, after a devillish
manner. <i>Alch.</i> O what doe I hear? this certainly is
a devill indeed, for I do all things according to the
writings of Philosophers, and know very well how
to work. <i>Merc.</i> Thou knowest very well, for thou
dost more then thou knowest, or readst of: for the
Philosophers said, that Nature is to be mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
Natures; and they command nothing to bee done
without Nature; but thou dost mix mee with almost
all the sordidst things that bee, as dung. <i>Alch.</i> I doe
nothing besides Nature; but I sow seed into its own
earth, as the Philosophers have said. <i>Merc.</i> Thou
sowest mee in dung, and in time of harvest I do vanish
away, and thou art wont to reap dung. <i>Alc.</i> Yet so the
Philosophers have wrote, that in the dunghill their
matter is to be sought for. <i>Merc.</i> It is true what they
have written; but thou understandest their letter, and
not their sense, and meaning. <i>Alch.</i> Now happily I
see that thou art Mercury; but thou wilt not obey
mee. And he began to conjure him again, saying, <i>Vx
Vx</i>. But Mercury laughing answered, Thou shalt doe
no good, my friend. <i>Alch.</i> They do not speak without
ground, when they say thou art of a strange nature,
inconstant, and volatile. <i>Merc.</i> Dost thou say,
that I am inconstant, I resolve thee thus, I am constant
unto a constant Artificer; fixed to him, that is
of a fixed mind, but thou, and such as thou art, are
inconstant, running from one thing unto another,
from one matter unto another. <i>Alch.</i> Tell me therefore
if thou art that Mercury, which the Philosophers
wrote of, which they said was, together with
sulphur, and salt the principall of all things, or must
I seek after another? <i>Mer.</i> Truly the fruit doth not fal
far from the tree, but I seek not mine own praise, I am
the same as I was, but my years are differing. From
the beginning I was young, so long as I was alone, but
now I am older, yet the same as I was before. <i>Alch.</i>
Now thou pleasest me, because now thou art older:
for I alwaies sought after such a one, that was more
ripe, and fixed, that I might so much the more easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
accord with him. <i>Merc.</i> Thou dost in vain look after
mee in my old age, who didst not know mee in my
youth. <i>Alch.</i> Did not I know thee, who have worked
with thee divers wayes, as thou thy selfe hast said?
and yet I will not leave off till I have made the Philosophers
Stone. <i>Merc.</i> O what a miserable case am I
in? What shall I do? I must now be mixed again with
dung, and be tormented. O wretch that I am! I
beseech thee good Master Philosopher, doe not mix
me so much with hogs dung; for otherwise I shall
be undone, for by reason of this stink I am constrained
to change my shape. And what wilt thou have
mee doe more? Am not I tormented sufficiently
by thee? Doe not I obey thee? Doe not I mixe my
self with those things thou wilt have me? Am I not
sublimed? Am I not precipitated? Am I not made turbith?
An Amalgama? A Past? Now what canst thou
desire more of me? My body is so scourged, so spit
upon, that the very stone would pity me: By vertue of
me thou hast milk, flesh, bloud, butter, oyl, water, and
which of all the metalls, or mineral can do that which
I do alone? and is there no mercy to be had towards
me? O what a wretch am I! <i>Alc.</i> O ho, it doth not hurt
thee, thou art wicked, although thou turnest thy
self inside out, yet thou dost not change thy selfe,
thou dost but frame to thy selfe a new shape, thou
dost alwaies return into thy first forme again. <i>Merc.</i>
I doe as thou wilt have me, if thou wilt have me be a
body, I am a body: if thou will have me be dust, I
am dust, I know not how I should abase my self more,
then when I am dust, and a shadow. <i>Alch.</i> Tell mee
therefore what thou art in thy Center, and I will
torment thee no more. <i>Merc.</i> Now I am constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
to tell from the very foundation. If thou wilt thou
maist understand mee: thou seest my shape, and of
this thou needest not know further. But because thou
askest mee of the Center, my Center is the most
fixed heart of all things, immortall, and penetrating:
in that my Master rests, but I my selfe am the
way, and the passenger, I am a stranger, and yet live
at home, I am most faithfull to all my companions, I
leave not those that doe accompany mee; I abide
with them, I perish with them. I am an immortall
body: I die indeed when I am slaine, but
I rise againe to judgement before a wise Judge.
<i>Alch.</i> Art thou therefore the Philosophers Stone?
<i>Merc.</i> My mother is such a one, of her is born artificially
one certain thing, but my brother who dwells
in the fort, hath in his will what the Philosophers
desire. <i>Alch.</i> Art thou old? <i>Merc.</i> My mother begat
mee, but I am older then my mother. <i>Alch.</i> What
devill can understand thee, when thou dost not answer
to the purpose? thou alwaies speakest Riddles.
Tell mee if thou art that fountain of which <i>Bernard</i>
Lord <i>Trevisan</i> writ? <i>Merc.</i> I am not the fountaine,
but I am the water, the fountaine compasseth mee
about. <i>Alch.</i> Is gold dissolved in thee, when thou
art water? <i>Merc.</i> Whatsoever is with mee I love as
a friend; and whatsoever is brought forth with mee,
to that I give nourishment, and whatsoever is naked,
I cover with my wings. <i>Alch.</i> I see it is to no purpose
to speak to thee, I ask one thing, and thou answerest
another thing: if thou wilt not answer to my
question, truly I will goe to work with thee again.
<i>Merc.</i> O master, I beseech thee be good to me, now
I will willingly doe what I know. <i>Alch.</i> Tell mee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
therefore if thou art afraid of the fire. <i>Merc.</i> I am
fire my selfe. <i>Alch.</i> And why then dost thou fly
from the fire? <i>Merc.</i> My spirit, and the spirit of the
fire love one another, and whither one goes, the other
goes if it can. <i>Alch.</i> And whither dost thou goe,
when thou ascendest with the fire? <i>Merc.</i> Know that
every stranger bends towards his own countrey, and
when he is returned from whence he came, hee is at
rest, and alwaies returnes wiser, then he was when he
came forth. <i>Alch.</i> Dost thou come back again sometimes?
<i>Merc.</i> I doe, but in another forme. <i>Alch.</i> I do
not understand what this is, nor any thing of the fire.
<i>Merc.</i> If any one knew the fire of my heart, hee hath
seen that fire (a due heat) is my meat: and by how
much the longer the spirit of my heart feeds upon
fire, it will be so much the fatter, whose death is
afterward the life of all things, whatsoever they bee
in this Kingdome where I am. <i>Alch.</i> Art thou great?
<i>Merc.</i> I am thus for example, of a thousand drops I
shall be one, out of one I give many thousand drops:
and as my body is in thy sight, if thou knowest how
to sport with mee, thou maist divide me into as much
as thou wilt, and I shall be one again: What then is
my spirit (my heart) intrinsecally, which alwaies
can bring forth many thousands out of the least part?
<i>Alch.</i> And how therefore must one deale with thee
that thou maist be so? <i>Merc.</i> I am fire within, fire is
my meat, but the life of the fire is aire, without aire
the fire is extinguished; the fire prevails over the aire,
wherefore I am not at rest, neither can the crude aire
constringe, or bind mee: adde aire to aire, that both
may be one, and hold weight, join it to warme fire,
and give it time. <i>Alch.</i> What shall bee after that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
<i>Merc.</i> The superfluous shall be taken away, the residue
thou shalt burn with fire, put it into water, boyl
it, after it is boyled thou shalt give it to the sick by
way of physick. <i>Alch.</i> Thou saist nothing to my
questions. I see that thou wilt only delude mee with
Riddles. Wife, bring hither the hogs dung, I will
handle that Mercury some new wayes, untill hee tell
mee how the Philosophers Stone is to bee made of
him. Mercury hearing this begins to lament over the
Alchymist, and goes unto his mother Nature: accuseth
the ungratefull operator. Nature beleeves her
son Mercury, who tells true, and being moved with
anger comes to the Alchymist, and calls him; Ho
thou, Where art thou? <i>Alchym.</i> Who is that,
thus calls mee? <i>Natura.</i> What dost thou with my
son, thou fool thou? Why dost thou thus injure him?
Why dost thou torment him? who is willing to doe
thee any good, if thou couldst understand so much.
<i>Alch.</i> What devill reprehends me, so great a man,
and Philosopher? <i>Nat.</i> O fool ful of pride, the dung of
Philosophers, I know all Philosophers, and wise men,
and I love them, for they love me, and doe all things
for me at my pleasure, and whither I cannot goe
they help me. But you Alchymists, of whose order
thou also art one, without my knowledg, and consent,
doe all things contrary unto me; wherefore it falls
out contrary to your expectation. You think that you
deal with my sons rationally, but you perfect nothing;
and if you will consider rightly, you do not
handle them, but they handle you: for you can make
nothing of them, neither know you how to do it, but
they of you when they please, make fooles. <i>Alch.</i> It
is not true: I also am a Philosopher, and know well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
how to worke, I have been with more then one
Prince, and was esteemed a Philosopher amongst
them, my wife also knows the same, and now also
I have a manuscript, which was hid some hundreds
of years in an old wall, now I certainly know
I shall make the Philosophers Stone, as also within
these few dayes it was revealed to mee in a dreame. O
I am wont to have true dreams; Wife thou knowest
it! <i>Natur.</i> Thou shalt doe as the rest of thy fellowes
have done, who in the beginning know all
things, and thinke they are very knowing, but in
conclusion know nothing. <i>Alch.</i> Yet others have
made it of thee (if thou art the true Nature.) <i>Nat.</i>
It is true, but only they that knew me, and they are
very few. But hee which knowes mee doth not torment
my Sons; nor disturbe mee, but doth to mee
what hee pleaseth, and increaseth my goods, and heals
the bodies of my sons. <i>Alch.</i> Even so do I. <i>Natur.</i>
Thou dost all things contrary to mee, and dost proceed
with my Sonnes contrary to my will: when
thou shouldst revive, thou killest; when fix, thou
sublimest; when calcine, thou distillest; especially
my most observant Sonne Mercury, whom thou
tormentest with so many corrosive waters, and so
many poisonous things. <i>Alch.</i> Then I will proceed
with him sweetly by digestion only. <i>Natur.</i> It is well
if thou knowest how to doe it, but if not, thou
shalt not hurt him, but thy selfe, and expose thy selfe
to charges, for it is all one with him, as with a gem,
which is mixed with dung, that is alwaies good,
and the dung doth not diminish it, although it be
cast upon it, for when it is washed, it is the same
gemme as it was before. <i>Alch.</i> But I would wil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>lingly
know how to make the Philosophers Stone.
<i>Natur.</i> Therefore doe not handle my Son in that
fashion: for know, that I have many Sonnes, and
many Daughters, and I am ready at hand to them
that seek mee, if they bee worthy of mee. <i>Alch.</i>
Tell me therefore who that Mercury is? <i>Nat.</i> Know
that I have but one such Sonne, and hee is one of
seven, and hee is the first; and hee is all things,
who was but one; hee is nothing, and his number
is entire; in him are the foure Elements, and yet
himselfe is no Element; he is a spirit, and yet hath
a body; he is a man, and yet acts the part of a
woman; hee is a child, and yet bears the armes of
a man; hee is a beast, and yet hath the wings of
a bird; hee is poison, yet cureth the leprosie; he
is life, yet kills all things; hee is a King, yet another
possesseth his Kingdome; hee flyeth from the
fire, yet fire is made of him; hee is water, yet
wets not; hee is earth, yet hee is sowed; hee is
aire, yet lives in water. <i>Alch.</i> Now I see that I
know nothing, but I dare not say so, for then I
should lose my reputation, and my neighbors will
lay out no more money upon mee, if they should
know that I know nothing: yet I will say that I
doe certainly know, or else no body will give mee
so much as bread: for many of them hope for much
good from mee. <i>Natur.</i> Although thou shouldst
put them off a great while, yet what will become
of thee at last? and especially if thy neighbours
should demand their charges of thee again? <i>Alch.</i> I
will feed all of them with hope, as much as possibly
I can. <i>Natur.</i> And then what wilt thou doe at
last? <i>Alch.</i> I will try many ways privately: if either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
of them succeed, I will pay them; if not, I will goe
into some other far Country, and doe the like there.
<i>Natur.</i> And what will become of thee afterward?

<p>eeing I might not write more cleerly, then
other ancient Philosophers have wrote; haply
thou mayst not bee satisfied with my
writings: especially since thou hast so many other
bookes of Philosophers already in thy hands: but
beleeve me, neither have I any need to write books,
because I seek neither profit, nor vain glory by them;
therefore I doe not publish who I am. Those things
which I have now publisht for thy profit, and advantage,
seem to mee to be more then enough; I purpose
that other things, which remain, shall bee referred to
the book of Harmony, where I have largely treated
of naturall things: yet by the perswasion of some
friends I must needs also write this Treatise of Sulphur;
in which whether it be needfull to adde any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
thing to what is written before, I know not. Yea,
neither shall this satisfie thee, if the writings of so
many Philosophers cannot satisfie thee: And especially,
if the daily operation of Nature bee not a
sufficient example, no other examples shall doe thee
good. For if thou wouldst consider with a mature
judgement, how Nature works, thou wouldst not
have need of so many volumes of Philosophers: because
in my judgement it is better to learn of Nature
the Mistris, then of her scholars. Thou hast enough
in the Preface of the book of the Twelve Treatises,
as also in the First Treatise it self, because in this Art
there be so many, and so great books to bee found,
that they rather hinder, then help those that are studious
of this Art: and so indeed it seems to be, because
the Writings of Philosophers are out of that little
Schedule of <i>Hermes</i> grown up unto so great, and erroneous
a Labyrinth, and daily doe decline into obscurity:
And this I beleeve is done only by envious
Philosophers, when as the ignorant doe not well
know what ought to be added, or left out, if haply
the Authours hand cannot well be read. If in any
Science, or Art it doth much help, or hurt to have
one word lacking, or added, then much more in this:
As for example: It is written in one place: <i>Then mix
these waters together</i>, another addes <i>Not</i>, hee indeed
added but a little, and yet by this he turned the whole
Chapter quite contrary: yet let the diligent Student
know, that a Bee doth gather honey out of poisonous
hearbs. But if he judgeth what hee reads, according
to the possibility of Nature, hee will easily get
beyond all the Sophistry of Philosophers: yet let
him not give over reading, because one booke ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>plaines
another. And by this meanes I understood
that the bookes of <i>Geber</i> the Philosopher (and who
could know it, but they that read other Authours?)
are so wonderfully enchanted, that they cannot possibly
be understood, unlesse they be read over a thousand
times, and this also by a witty Reader; fooles
must bee utterly excluded from reading of them.
There bee indeed many that undertake to interpret
him as they doe other Authors; but I see their explication
is more difficult then the text: My advice is,
that thou dost persist in the text, and whatsoever
thou readest apply to the possibility of Nature; and
in the first place enquire diligently what Nature is.
All indeed write, that shee is a thing of small account,
easy, common; and indeed it is true, but it
should have been added, that shee is so unto wise
men. The wise man knows her to be amongst dung,
and the ignorant man doth not beleeve her to bee
in gold. And all these men, which have made such
hard bookes, if they were now ignorant of the Art,
but must find it out of such bookes (which books indeed
are very true) would with more difficulty find
it out, then men, that in these days search into the art,
doe. I will not commend mine owne Writings, hee
shall judge of them that shall apply them to the possibility,
and course of Nature; and if by my Writings,
Counsell, Examples, hee shall not know
the operation of Nature, and her ministring vitall
spirits constringing the aire, as also the subject of the
first matter, hee will scarce understand them by <i>Raimundus
Lullius</i>. It is a hard thing to beleeve that
spirits have such a power and force in the belly of the
wind. This Wood I also am constrained to goe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
through, and also I have helped to multiply it, yet
in such a manner as my plants shall be signes, a light,
and guides to the true Sons of Art, and Students in
this sacred Science, that are willing to goe through
this Wood; for my plants are as it were corporeall.
Those times are now past, when fidelity amongst
friends flourished, and this Art was communicated
by word of mouth; but now it is not obtained but
by the inspiration of the most high God alone.
Therefore let not him that searcheth diligently, and
fears God despaire. If he seeks after it, hee shall find
it. Because it is more easily obtained from God,
then from man: for hee is a God of infinite compassion,
and knowes not how to forsake him that puts his
trust in him; with him there is no respect of persons;
the contrite and humble heart hee will not despise,
and hee hath taken compassion upon mee, the most
unworthy of his creatures; whose power, goodness,
unspeakable compassion which he hath vouchsafed to
shew to mee, I am not able to expresse: but if I am
able to give no better thankes, yet I shall not cease
with my pen to set forth his praise for ever. Bee of
good courage therefore, Courteous Reader, and hee
will also not deny this favour to thee, if thou puttest
thy whole trust in him, worship him, and call upon
him, hee will open to thee the gate of Nature; then
thou shalt see how most plainly Nature works. Know
for certain that Nature is most plain, and simple, and
delights in nothing so much as in plainnesse; and beleeve
mee, whatsoever in Nature is more noble, by so
much also the more easy, and plain it is, because all
truth is plain, and simple: God the most High Creator
of all things put nothing that is hard, or difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
in Nature. If thou wilt therefore imitate Nature,
let mee perswade thee to abide in the simple way of
Nature; and thou shalt find all good things. But if
neither my writings, nor advise pleaseth thee, then go
to other authors. Wherefore I write not great Volumes
that thou maist not lay out too much money,
or time upon them, but maist read them over quickly,
and bee at the more leisure to have recourse to
other authors: and cease not to seek, for to him that
knocks, it shall bee opened. Now those times are
coming, in which many secrets of Nature shall bee
revealed. Now that fourth Monarchy of the North
is about to begin: Now the times are at hand; the
Mother of Sciences will come: greater things shall
bee discovered then hath been done in these three last
past Monarchies. Because this Monarchy (as the
Ancients have foretold) God will plant by one of
his Princes, being enriched with all manner of vertues,
whom haply times have already brought forth.
For wee have in this Northerne part a most wise
Prince, and most warlike, whom none of the Monarchs
doth goe beyond in victories, or excell in
humanity, and piety. In this Northerne Monarchy
God the maker of all things, will without doubt
bring to light greater secrets in Nature, then in
those times, when Pagan, and Tyrant Princes reigned.
But the Philosophers reckon these Monarchies, not
according to the powerfulnesse of them, but according
to the corners of the world: the first was Easterne,
the next Southerne; this which they now
possesse is Westerne: the last which they expect
in this Northerne part is Northerne: but of these
further in my booke of Harmony. In this Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>thern
Monarchy, where the attractive pole is (as
the <i>Psalmist</i> speaks) Mercy and Truth are met together;
Peace, and Justice shall kisse each other;
Truth shall rise out of the earth, and Justice shall
looke from heaven. One sheepfold, and one
Shepheard. Many Arts without envy: All
which I doe earnestly expect. Doe thou also,
Courteous Reader, call upon, love, feare God,
read over my Writings diligently, and then thou
maist foretell to thy selfe good things. And if
thou shalt, through the favour of God, and the
help of Nature (whom thou must imitate) arrive
to the desired haven of this Monarchie; then thou
shalt see, and say that all things that I have said to
thee, are good, and true.</p>

<p>ulphur is not the last amongst the
Principles, because it is a part of the
Metall; yea and the principall part of
the Philosophers Stone: and many wise
men have left in writing divers, and
very true things of Sulphur. Yea <i>Geber</i>
himself in his first book of the highest perfection, <i>cha.</i>
28. saith: Through the most High God it illuminates
every body: because it is light from light, and
Tincture. But before wee treate of it, it seems good
to us to first describe the originall of the Principles;
especially since of old, Sulphur hath been accounted
the chiefest of the Principles. Now very few have
hitherto shewed whence the Principles arise, and it is
a hard thing to judge of any of the Principles, or
anything else, whose originall, and generation is
unknowne: what can a blind man judg of a colour?
What our predecessors have omitted, that have
wee purposed in this Treatise to supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Now the Principles of things, especially of Metalls,
according to the ancient Philosophers are two,
Sulphur; and Mercury: but according to the latter
Philosophers, three, Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury. Now
the originall of these Principles are the foure Elements;
with the originall of which also wee will first
begin. Therefore let them that are Students in
this sacred science know, that there are four Elements,
and that every one of these foure hath in its Center
another Element, by which it is elementated: and
these are the four statues of the world, separated from
the Chaos in the creation of the world by divine
wisdome; and these uphold the fabrick of the world
by their contrary acting, in equality, and proportion,
and also by the inclination of celestiall
vertues, bring forth all things, that are within, and
upon the earth: but of these in their places: here we
will returne to our purpose; and first of the Element
that is neerest, <i>viz.</i> the Earth.</p>

<p>he Earth is of great worth in its quality,
and dignity: in this Element, the other
three, especially the fire, rest. It is the
most excellent Element to conceale, and
discover those things which are intrusted to it: it is
grosse, and porous, heavy in respect of its smallnesse,
but light in respect of its Nature; it is
also the Center of the world, as also of the other
Elements; through its Center passeth the axell tree
of the world, and of both poles. It is porous, as
wee said, as a spunge, and brings forth nothing of it
selfe, but all things whatsoever the other three distil,
and project into it, it receives, keeps all things that
are to be kept, brings to light all things that are to be
brought to light. It brings forth (as wee said before)
nothing of it selfe, but it is the receptacle of
other things, and it is that, in which every thing
that is brought forth, doth abide, and by heat of motion
is putrefied in it, and is multiplied by the same,
the pure being separated from the impure: That
which is heavy in it is hid, and the heat drives that
which is light unto its superficies. It is the nurse, and
matrix of all seed, and commixtion. It can indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
doe nothing else, then preserve the seed, and what
is made of it, till it be ripe. It is cold, dry, tempered
with water; visible without, and fixed; but within
invisible, and volatile. It is a virgin, and the <i>Caput
Mortuum</i> left after the creation of the world, which
shall hereafter at divine pleasure bee calcined, after
extraction of its moisture, that of it a new Crystalline
Earth may be created. Also this Element is divided
into a pure part, and an impure. The water
makes use of the pure to bring forth things, but the
impure remains in its globe. This Element is the hiding
place, and mansion of all treasure. In its Center
is the fire of hell, preserving this fabrick of the world
in its being; and this by the expression of water into
the aire. That fire is caused, and kindled by the <i>primum
Mobile</i>, and the influences of the Stars: the heat
of the Sunne tempered with the aire meets with this
heat for the ripening, and drawing up of those things,
which are already conceived in its Center. Moreover
the Earth partakes of fire, which is the intrinsecall
part of it, neither is it purified but in the fire: and so
every Element is purified with its intrinsecall part.
Now the Intrinsecall part, or inside of the Earth, or
its Center is the highest purity mixed with fire, where
nothing can rest: It is as it were an empty place, into
which all the other Elements doe project their vertues,
as hath been spoken in the book of the Twelve
Treatises. And thus much of the Element of Earth,
which wee have called a Spunge, and the receptacle
of other things, which serveth for our purpose.</p>

<p>ater is the heaviest Element, full of
unctuous flegme, and it is an Element
more worthy in its quality then the
Earth, without, volatile, but within fixed,
it is cold, and moist, and tempered
with the aire: it is the sperm of the world, in which
the seed of all things is kept: it is the keeper of the
seed of every thing. Yet wee must know, that the
Seed is one thing, and the Sperme another: the
Earth is the receptacle of the Sperme, but Water is
the receptacle of the Seed. Whatsoever the Aire
doth distill into the Water, by means of the fire,
the same doth the water convey to the Earth. Sometimes
the sperme lackes sufficiency of seed, for want
of heat which should digest it; for there is alwayes
plenty of Sperm, expecting Seed, which by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
imagination of fire through the motion of the Aire
it carryes into its matrix: and sometimes there being
lack of Seed, the Sperme enters, but it goeth forth
againe without fruit: but of this more at large hereafter
in the third Treatise of Principles, <i>viz.</i> in that
of Salt. It happens sometimes in Nature, that the
Sperme enters into the matrix with a sufficiency of
Seed; but the matrix being indisposed, by reason of
being filled with offensive, sulphureous, &amp; flegmatick
vapors, doth not conceive, neither doth that come
to passe that should. Also nothing is properly in this
Element, but only as it is wont to bee in the Sperm.
It is delighted chiefly in its own motion, which is
made by the Aire, and it is apt to mixe with things
by reason of its superficiall, volatile body. It is, as
wee said before, the receptacle of all manner of Seed:
in it the Earth is easily purified, and resolved; and the
Aire is congealed in it, and is joined with it radically.
It is the menstruum of the world, which penetrating
the Aire, by means of heat, drawes along with it
selfe a warm vapour, which causeth a naturall generation
of those things, which the Earth, as a matrix
is impregnated withall, and when the matrix receives
a due proportion of Seed, of what kind soever, it
proceeds, and Nature workes without intermission
to the end; but the remaining moisture, or Sperme
falls to the side, and by vertue of the heat in the
Earth is putrefied (that which is cast to the side) and
of that afterwards are generated other things, as
small vermine, and wormes. The Artificer of a
quicke wit may indeed see in this Element, as it were
out of Sperme, divers wonders of Nature; but it will
be needfull to take that Sperm, in which the Astrall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
Seed in a certaine proportion is already imagined, or
conceived; because Nature makes, and produceth
pure things by the first putrefaction, but by the second
farre more pure, worthy, and noble; as thou
hast an example in wood, which is vegetable, where
in the first composition Nature maketh wood, but
when that is after maturity corrupted, it is putrefied,
and of it worms are bred, and such kind of vermine
as they are, which have both life, and sight: for it is
manifest, that a sensible thing is alwaies more worthy
then a vegetable: for to the organs of sensible
things much more subtile, and purer matter is required:
But to return to our purpose.</p>

<p>This Element is the Menstruum of the world, and
is divided into three sorts, <i>viz.</i> pure, purer, and most
pure. Of the most pure substance of it the Heavens
are created, the purer is resolved into Aire, but the
pure, plaine, and grosse remains in its sphere, and by
divine appointment, and operation of Nature doth
preserve and keep every thing that is subtile. It
makes one globe together with the Earth: it hath
also its Center in the heart of the Sea: it hath one
axell tree and pole with the earth, by which all courses,
and fountaines of water issue forth, which afterward
increase, and grow up into great rivers. By these
issuing forth of waters the Earth is preserved from
burnings, and with this moistning the universall Seed
is carryed forth through the pores of the whole
Earth, which thing is caused through heat, and
motion. Now it is manifest that all courses of
Waters return into the heart of the Sea; but whither
afterward they run is not known to every body. There
be some that think that all rivers, water, and springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
which have their course into the sea, do proceed from
the stars, who, when they know no other reason why
the sea should not increase, and bee fuller, by reason of
them, say that these Waters are consumed in the heart
of the sea. But this Nature will not admit of, as
wee have shewed when we spake of the Rain. The
stars indeed cause, but doe not generate Water; seeing
nothing is generated but in its owne like of the
same species: Now the Stars consist of Fire, and
Aire; how then should they generate Waters? And
if it were so, that some Starre should generate Waters,
then necessarily also must others generate Earth,
and also others other Elements: because this fabrick
of the world is so upheld by the four Elements, that
one may not exceed another in the least particle, but
they strive one with the other in an equall ballance;
for otherwise if one should exceed the other, destruction
would ensue. Yet let every one persevere in
what opinion hee please, it is thus shewed to us by the
light of Nature, that this fabrick of the world is
preserved by these four Elements, their equality being
proportioned by the great God, and one doth
not exceed the other in its operation. But the Waters
upon the basis of the Earth are contained as it
were in some vessell from the motion of the Aire, and
towards the Articke pole are by it constringed, because
there is no <i>vacuum</i>, or vacuity in the world: for
this cause is there in the Center of the Earth the fire
of hell, which the Archeus of Nature doth govern.</p>

<p>For in the beginning of the Creation of the world,
the great and good God out of the confused Chaos,
in the first place exalted the quintessence of the Ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>ments,
&amp; that is made the utmost bound of all things:
then he lifted up the most pure substance of fire above
all things, to place his most Sacred Majesty in, and set
and established it in its bound. In the Center of the
chaos (by the good pleasure of Gods infinite wisdom)
that Fire was kindled, which afterward did distil those
most pure waters. But because now that most pure fire
hath obtained the place of the Firmament, together
with the throne of the most high God, the waters are
condensed under that Fire: and that they might be the
more strongly fortified, &amp; setled, the fire that is grosser
then the former, was then raised (this by means of
the Centrall Fire) and remained in the sphere of Fire
under the Waters: and so the Waters are congealed,
and shut up betwixt two Fires in the heavens. But
that Centrall Fire never ceaseth, but distilling more
Waters, and those lesse pure, did resolve them into
Aire, which also abides under the sphere of Fire in
its proper sphere, and is enclosed by the Element of
Fire, as with a sure, and strong foundation; and as
the Waters of the Heavens, cannot goe beyond that
supercelestiall Fire, so the Element of Fire cannot go
beyond the Waters of the Heavens, neither can the
Aire go beyond, or be exalted above the Element of
Fire. As for the Water, and the Earth, they remained
in one globe, because they have no place in the Aire,
except that part of the Water, which the Fire doth
resolve into Aire, for the daily fortifying of this fabricke
of the world. For if there had been a vacuity
in the Aire, then all the Waters had distilled, and
been resolved into Aire: but now the sphere of the
Aire is full, and is alwaies filled through the distilling
Waters, by the continuall Centrall heat, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
rest of the Waters are by the compression of the
Aire rolled round the Earth, and with the Earth
make up the Center of the world; and this operation
is performed dayly, and so also this world is fortified
daily, and shall for ever bee naturally preserved
from corruption, unlesse it bee the good pleasure of
the most High Creator (whose will is absolute) that
it shall be otherwise. Because that Centrall Fire never
ceaseth to bee kindled by the universall motion,
and influence of the heavenly vertues, and so to warm
the Waters; neither shall the Waters cease to bee
resolved into Aire; neither shall the Aire cease to
compresse, and keep down the residue of the Waters
with the Earth, and so to contain them in the Center,
that they may not bee moved out of their Center:
thus even in a naturall manner this world is made, and
continued through the mighty wisdome of God; and
so according to the example of this it is necessary
that all things in the world bee naturally made. We
are willing to discover to thee further this creation
of this fabricke of the world, that thou maist know
that the foure Elements have a naturall sympathy
with the superior, because they were made out of
one and the same Chaos: but they are governed by
the superior, as the more worthy; and from thence
came this obedience into this sublunary place. But
know that all those things were naturally found out
by the Philosopher, as shal be shewed in its own place.
Now to our purpose concerning the Courses of Waters,
and the ebbing &amp; flowing of the Sea, how by the
polarie Axell tree they are carryed from one pole to
another. There are two Poles, the one is Artick, and
in that part that is superior, and Northerne, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
other Antarticke under the Earth, and in the Southerne
part. The Articke pole hath a magneticke
vertue of attracting, but the Antarticke pole hath a
magneticke vertue of expelling, or driving from:
and this Nature holds forth to us in the example of
the Loadstone. The Articke pole therefore drawes
Waters by the Axell-tree, which after they are
entred in, break forth again by the Axell tree of the
Antarticke pole: and because the Aire doth not
suffer an inequality, they are constrained to return to
the Articke pole, their Center, and so continually to
observe this Course. In which Course from the
Articke pole, to the Antarticke pole by the midle,
or Axell-tree of the world, they are dispersed
through the pores of the Earth, and so according to
more or lesse do springs arise, and afterward meeting
together increase, and become to be rivers, and are
again returned thither, from whence they came out;
and this is uncessantly done through the universall
motion. Some (as I said before) being ignorant of
the universall motion, and the operations of the poles
say that these Waters are consumed in the heart of
the sea, and generated by the stars, which produce,
and generate no materiall thing, impressing only vertues,
and spirituall <span class="correction" title="In the original book: influencies">influences</span>, which cannot give
any weight to things. Waters therefore are not
generated; but know that they come forth from the
Center of the Sea, through the pores of the Earth
into the whole world. From these naturall Conclusions,
or Principles Philosophers have found out divers
instruments, and conveyances of Waters, as
also fountaines, since it is known, that Waters cannot
naturally ascend higher then that place is, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
whence they come; and unlesse it were so in Nature,
Art could never doe it, because Art imitates Nature;
and that which is not in Nature cannot succeed
by Art; for Water, as I said before, doth not
ascend higher then the place from whence it was taken:
thou hast for an example that instrument, with
which Wine is drained out of a barrell.</p>

<p>To conclude therefore, know that Springs, or
breakings forth of Water are not generated of Stars,
but that they come from the Center of the Sea,
whither they return, and that thus they observe a
continuall motion. For if this were not so, nothing
at all either in the earth, or upon the earth could
be generated, yea the ruine of the world would of
necessity follow. But lest it may bee objected, that
in the Sea all Waters are salt, and that the Waters
of Springs are sweet: Know, that this is the reason,
because that Water distills through the pores
of the Earth, and passing many miles through narrow
places, and through sands, the saltnesse being
lost, is made sweet: After the example of which
Cisterns are found out. There are also in some places
greater and larger pores, and passages, through
which salt Water breaks through, where afterwards
are made salt pits, and fountains, as at <i>Halla</i> in
<i>Germany</i>. Also in some places the Waters are constringed
with heat, and the salt is left in the sands,
but the Water sweats through other pores, as in
<i>Polonia</i>, at <i>Wielicia</i>, and <i>Bochia</i>: So also when Waters
passe through places, that are hot, sulphureous,
and continually burning, they are made hot, from
whence Bathes arise: for there are in the bowells of
the Earth places, in which Nature distills, and sepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>rates
a sulphureous Mine, where, by the Centrall Fire
it is kindled. The Water running through these
burning places, according to the neernesse or remotenesse
are more or lesse hot, and so breaks forth
into the superficies of the Earth, and retains the tast
of Sulphur, as all broth doth of the flesh, that is
boiled in it. After the same manner it is, when Water
passing through places where are Mineralls, as
Copper, Allum, doth acquire the savour of them.
Such therefore is the Distiller, the Maker of all
things, in whose hands is this Distillatory, according
to the example of which all distillations have been
invented by Philosophers; which thing the most
High God himself out of pity, without doubt, hath
inspired into the sons of men: and he can, when it
is his holy will, either extinguish the Centrall Fire, or
break the vessell, and then there will be an end of all.
But since his goodnesse doth intend the bettering of
all things, hee will at length exalt his most sacred
Majesty, and raise up higher the purest Fire of all,
which is higher then the Waters of the Heavens
which are above the Firmament, and will give it a
stronger degree of heat then the Centrall Fire, that
all the Waters may bee exhaled up into the Aire,
and the Earth be calcined, and so the Fire, all the impurity
being consumed, will make the Waters of
the purified Earth, being circulated in the Aire, to be
more subtile, and will (if wee may thus speak in a way
of Philosophy) make a world much more excellent.</p>

<p>Therefore let all the Searchers of this Art know,
that the Earth, and Water make one globe, and being
together make all things, because they are tangible
Elements, in which the other two being hid doe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
work. The Fire preserves the Earth, that it bee not
drowned, or dissolved: the Aire preserves the Fire
that it bee not extinguished: the Water preserves the
Earth that it bee not burnt. It seemed good to us to
describe these things, as conducing to our purpose,
that the studious may know, in what things the foundations
of the Elements consist, and how Philosophers
have observed their contrary actings; joining
Fire with Earth, and Aire with Water: although
when they would doe any excellent thing, they have
boiled Fire in Water, considering that one blood is
purer then another, as a tear is purer then urine. Let
that therefore suffice which we have spoken, <i>viz.</i> that
the Element of Water is the Sperm, and Menstruum
of the world, as also the receptacle of the Seed.</p>

<p>he Aire is an entire Element, most worthy
of the three in its quality, without, light,
and invisible, but within, heavy, visible, and
fixed, it is hot, and moist, and tempered
with Fire, and more worthy then Earth, &amp; Water. It is
volatil, but may be fixed; and when it is fixed, it makes
every body penetrable. Of its most pure substance
the vitall spirits of living Creatures are made; that
which is lesse pure is taken up into its proper sphere of
the Aire; but the residue, <i>viz.</i> the grosser part abides
in the Water, and is circulated with the Water, as
Fire with Earth, because they are friendly the one to
the other. It is most worthy, as wee have said; and it
is the true place of the Seed of all things: in it Seed is
imagined, as in man, which afterward by the circulating
motion is cast into its own Sperm. This Element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
hath the form of entirenesse to distribute the Seed
into Matrixes by the Sperm, and Menstruum of the
world. In it also is the vitall spirit of every Creature,
living in all things, penetrating, and constringing
the seed in other Elements, as Males doe in Females.
It nourisheth them, makes them conceive, and preserveth
them; and this daily experience teacheth, that
in this Element not only Mineralls, Animalls, or
Vegetables live but also other Elements. For wee see
that all Waters become putrefied, and filthy if they
have not fresh Aire: The Fire also is extinguished, if
the Aire be taken from it: (Thence Chymists come
to know how to dispose of their Fire into severall degrees
by means of the Aire, and to order their registers
according to the measure of the Air:) The pores
also of the Earth are preserved by Aire: In briefe, the
whole structure of the world is preserved by Aire.
Also in Animalls, Man dies if you take Aire from
him, &amp;c. Nothing would grow in the world, if there
were not a power of the Aire, penetrating, and altering,
bringing with it selfe nutriment that multiplies.
In this Element by vertue of the Fire is that imagined
Seed, which constringeth the Menstruum of the
world by its occult power, as in trees, and herbs, when
through the pores of the Earth, by the acting of the
spirituall heat, there goeth forth a Sperm with the
Seed, and the vertue of the Aire in a proportion
constringeth, and congeals it by drops; and so trees
by growing day after day, drop after drop, are at
length raised to be great trees; as wee have treated in
the book of the Twelve Treatises. In this Element
are all things entire through the imagination of Fire;
and it is full of divine vertue: for in it is included the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
Spirit of the most High, which before the Creation
was carryed upon the Waters, as saith the Scripture,
<i>And did fly upon the wings of the Wind</i>. If
therefore it bee so, as indeed it is, that the Spirit of
the Lord is carryed in it, why needs thou question
but that he hath left his divine vertue in it? For this
Monarch is wont to adorn his dwelling places; hee
hath adorned this Element with the vitall spirit of
every Creature: for in it is the seed of all things,
dispersed, in which presently after the Creation was
(as wee said before) by the great Maker of all things
included that magneticke vertue which if it had not,
it could not attract any nourishment, but so the Seed
must be left in a small quantity, neither would increase,
or bee multiplyed; but as the Loadstone
drawes to it self hard Iron (after the manner of the
Articke pole, drawing waters to it selfe, as we have
shewed in the Element of Water) so the Aire by a
Vegetable magnetick power, which is in the Seed,
draws to it selfe the nourishment of the Menstruum of
the world, <i>i.e.</i> Water. All these things are made by
Aire, for that is the leader of the Waters, and the occult
vertue thereof is included in all Seed for the attracting
of radicall moisture, and this vertue is, as
wee said before, alwaies the 280<sup>th.</sup> part in all Seed,
as wee have shewed thee in the third of the Twelve
Treatises. If therefore any one would successefully
plant trees, let him bee carefull that hee turne the
attractive point towards the Northern part; so hee
shall never lose his labour: for as the Articke pole
drawes to it selfe the Waters, so the verticle point
draws to it self Seed; and every attractive point doth
answer to them. Thou hast an example in all manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
of Wood, whose attractive point doth naturally
tend to the verticle point, and is drawne by it. For
let a bowle of Wood, if thou wilt know which is the
superior point, be put into water, and let it sink (so
that the water exceed the length of the Wood) thou
shalt alwaies see that point rise up before the opposite
part; for Nature knows not how to erre in her office:
but of these we shall treat further in our book called
<i>Harmonia</i>, where wee shall speak more of the magneticke
vertue (although he shall bee easily able to understand
the Loadstone, to whom the nature of Metalls
is knowne). Let this suffice that wee have said,
that this Element is the most worthy of the three in
which is Seed, and vitall spirit, or dwelling place of
the soule of every Creature.</p>

<p>ire is the purest, and most worthy Element
of all, full of unctuous corrosivenesse adhering
to it, penetrating, digesting, corroding,
and wonderfully adhering, without,
visible, but within invisible, and most fixed; it
is hot, dry, and tempered with Aire. Its substance
is the purest of all, and its essence was first of all
elevated in the Creation with the throne of divine
Majesty, when the Waters of the Heavens were
established, as we have said in the Element of Water:
out of the lesse pure part of its substance the Angells
were created; out of that which was lesse pure then
that, being mixed with the purest Aire, were the
Sun, Moon and Stars created. That which is lesse
pure then that is raised up to terminate, and hold up
the Heavens: but the impure, and unctuous part of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
is left, and included in the Center of the Earth by the
wise, and great Creator, for to continue the operation
of motion, and this wee call Hell. All these
Fires are indeed divided, but they have a Naturall
sympathy one towards another.</p>

<p>This Element is of all the most quiet, and like
unto a charriot, when it is drawed, it runs, when
it is not drawed, it stands still. It is also in all
things undiscernibly. In it are the reasons of life, and
understanding, which are distributed in the first infusion
of Mans life, and these are called the rational
soule, by which alone Man differs from other Creatures,
and is like to God. This soule is of that most
pure Elementary Fire, infused by God into the vitall
spirit, by reason of which Man after the Creation
of all things was created into a particular
World, or Microcosme. In this subject God the
Creator of all things put his seal, and Majesty, as in
the purest, and quietest subject, which is governed by
the will, and infinite wisdome of God alone. Wherefore
God abhors all impurity, nothing that is filthy
compounded, or blemished may come neer him,
therefore no mortall man can see God, nor come to
him naturally: for that Fire which is in the circumference
of the Divinity, in which is carryed the Seale
and Majesty of the Most High, is so intense, that
no eye can penetrate it: for Fire will not suffer any
thing that is compounded to come neer to it: for
Fire is the death, and separation of any thing that is
compounded. Wee have said that it is the most
quiet subject (for so it is) or else it would follow
(which so much as to thinke were absurd) that
God could not rest; for it is of most quiet silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
more then any mans mind can imagine. Thou hast
an example of this in the Flint, in which there is Fire,
and yet is not perceived, neither doth appear, untill
it be stirred up by motion, and kindled in it that it
may appear: so the Fire in which is placed the sacred
Majesty of our Creator, is not moved, unlesse it be
stirred up by the proper will of the most High, and
so is carryed where his holy Will is. There is made
by the Will of the supream Maker of all things a
most vehement, and terrible motion. Thou hast an
Example of this, when any Monarch of this world
sits in his pompe, What a quietnesse there is about
him? What silence? and although some one of his
Court doth more, the motion is only of some one,
or other particular man, which is not regarded. But
when the Lord himself moves, there is an universall
stirre, and motion, then all that attend on him, move
with him. What then? when that supream Monarch,
the King of Kings, and Maker of all things (after
whose example the Princes of the world are established
in the earth) doth move in his own person of
Majesty? What a stirre? What trembling, when
the whole guard of his heavenly Army move about
him? But some one may ask, How doe wee know
these things, since heavenly things are hid from Mans
understanding? To whom wee answer, that they are
manifest to all Philosophers; yea the incomprehensible
wisdome of God hath inspired into them, that
all things are created after the example of Nature,
and that Nature hath its bounds from those secret
things, and accordingly works; and that nothing is
done on the earth, but according to the example of
the heavenly Monarchy, which is managed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
the divers offices of Angells. So also there is nothing
brought forth, or generated, but what is done naturally.
All humane inventions, yea and Arts, which
either are, or shall bee, proceed not otherwise then
from Naturall principles. The most High Creator
was willing to manifest all Naturall things unto man,
wherefore hee shewed to us that Celestiall things
themselves were naturally made, by which his absolute,
and incomprehensible power, and wisdome
might be so much the better known; all which things
the Philosophers in the light of Nature, as in a
Looking-glasse, have the cleer sight of. For which
cause they esteemed highly of this Art, <i>viz.</i> not so
much out of covetousnesse for Gold, or Silver, but for
knowledge sake, not only of all Naturall things,
but also of the power of the Creator, and they were
willing to speak of these things sparingly, and only
figuratively, lest divine mysteries by which Nature
is illustrated, should be discovered to the unworthy,
which thou, if thou knowest how to know thy selfe,
and art not of a stiffe neck, maist easily comprehend;
who art created after the likenesse of the great world,
yea after the image of God. Thou hast in thy body
the Anatomy of the whole world, thou hast in stead
of the Firmament the quintessence of the foure Elements,
extracted out of the Chaos of Sperms, into a
matrix, and into a skin, which doth compasse it
round, thou hast most pure blood in stead of Fire, in
the vitall spirit whereof is placed the seat of the soule
(which is in stead of the King;) thou hast a heart in
stead of the earth; where the Centrall Fire continually
works; and preserves the fabrick of this Microcosm
in its being; thou hast thy mouth in stead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
Articke pole; and thy belly in stead of the Antarticke,
and all thy members answer to some Celestialls: of
which in our booke of Harmony wee shall treat more
fully, <i>viz.</i> in the Chapter of Astronomy, where we
have wrote how that Astronomy is easy, naturall, how
the aspects of Planets, and Stars are efficacious, and
why Prognostication is given of Raine, and other
events, which would bee too tedious to reckon up
here, and all these are linked together, and performed
in a naturall manner, onely God doth some things
extraordinary. Because the Ancients omitted it, we
are willing to shew it to him that is diligently studious
of this secret, that the incomprehensible power of
the most High God, may so much the more cleerly
come home to his heart, and that hee may love, and
adore him the more zealously. Let therefore the
Searcher of this sacred science know, that the soule
in a man the lesser world, or Microcosme substituting
the place of its Center, is the King, and is placed in
the vitall spirit, in the purest bloud. That governes
the mind, and the mind the body: when the soule
conceives any thing, the mind knows all things, and
all the members understand the mind, and obey the
mind, and are desirous to fulfill the will thereof.
For the body knows nothing, whatsoever strength,
or motion is in the body, is caused by the mind; the
body is to the mind, as instruments are to the Artificer;
Now the soule, by which man differs from other
Animalls, operates in the body, but it hath a greater
operation out of the body, because out of the body it
absolutely reigns, and by these things it differs from
other Animalls, who have only the mind, not the
soule of the Deity. So also God, the Maker of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
things, our Lord, and our God, works in this world
those things, which are necessary for the world;
and in these hee is included in the world; whence
wee beleeve that God is every where. But hee is
excluded the body of the world by his infinite wisdome,
by which hee workes out of the world, and
imagines much higher things, then the body
of the world is able to conceive, and those things are
beyond Nature, being the secrets of God alone. You
have the soul for an example, which out of the body
imagines many most profound things, and in this it is
like unto God, who out of the world works beyond
Nature; although the soule to God bee as it were a
candle lighted to the light at Noonday: for the soul
imagines, but executes not but in the mind; but God
doth effect all things the same moment when hee
imagines them; as the soul imagines any thing to be
done at <i>Rome</i>, or elsewhere in the twinckling of an
eye, but only in the mind; but God doth all such
things essentially, who is omnipotent. God therefore
is not included in the world, but as the soul in
the body; he hath his absolute power separated from
the world, so also the soul of any body hath its absolute
power separated from the body, to doe other
things then the body can conceive; it hath a very
great power therefore upon the body, if it pleaseth,
or otherwise our Philosophy were in vain. By these
therefore learn to know God, and thou shalt know in
which the Creator differs from the Creature. Thou
thy selfe shalt be able to conceive greater things,
when as now thou hast the gate opened by us. But
lest this Treatise should grow too big, let us returne
to our purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Wee said before that the Element of Fire is the
most quiet of all, and that it is stirred up by motion,
which stirring up wise men knew. It is necessary that
a Philosopher know the generation, and corruption
of all things, to whom not only the Creation of the
Heavens is manifest, but also the composition, and
mixture of all things: but although they know all
things, yet they cannot doe all things. We know indeed
the composition of Man in all respects, yet wee
cannot infuse the soule; because this mystery belongs
only unto God: &amp; he exceeds all things by these kind
of infinite mysteries. Seeing these are out of the corse
of Nature, they are not as yet in the disposition of
Nature: Nature doth not work before there be matter
given unto her to work upon. The first matter is
given to her by God, the second by the Philosopher.
Now in the operation of the Philosophers Nature
hath a power to stir up the fire, which by the Creator
is secretly included in the Center of every thing:
This stirring up of the fire is done by the will of Nature,
sometimes by the will of the skilfull Artificer
disposing of Nature. For naturally all impurities,
and pollutions of things are purged by Fire: All
things that are compounded, are dissolved by Fire:
as water washeth, and purgeth all things imperfect,
which are not fixed; so the Fire purgeth all things
that are fixed, and by Fire they are perfected: As
Water doth conjoine all things that are dissolved; so
fire separates all things that are conjoined; and what is
naturall, and of affinity with it, it doth very wel purge,
and augment it, not in quantity but in vertue. This element
doth severall ways secretly work upon other
Elements, and all things else: For as the Animall soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
is of the purest of this Element, so the Vegetable is
of the Elementary part of it, which is governed by
Nature. This Element doth act upon the Center of
every thing in this manner: Nature causeth Motion,
Motion stirs up Aire, the Aire the Fire; Now Fire
separates, cleanseth, digesteth, coloureth, and maketh
all seed to ripen, and being ripe expells it by the sperm
into places, and matrixes, into places pure or impure,
more or lesse hot, dry or moist; and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: acccording">according</span> to the
disposition of the matrix, or places, divers things are
brought forth in the earth, as in the booke of the
Twelve Treatises concerning Matrixes mention hath
been made, that there are as many Matrixes, as places.
So the Builder of all things, the most High
God hath determined, and ordained all things, that
one shall be contrary unto the other, yet so that the
death of the one be the life of the other: that which
produceth one, consumeth another, and another
thing from this is naturally produced, and such a
thing which is more noble then the former: and
by this means there is preserved an equality of the
Elements, and so also of the compositum. Separation
is of all things, especially of living things the
naturall death: Wherefore man must naturally die
because hee is compounded of four Elements, hee is
subject to separation, seing every thing that is compounded
is separated naturally. But this separation
of Mans composition must needs have been done in
the day of judgement, <i>i.e.</i> the first judgement, when
the sentence of a naturall death was passed upon him:
for in Paradise Man was immortall. Which all Divines,
as also Sacred Writ doth testifie; but a sufficient
reason of this immortality no Philosopher hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>therto
hath shewed; which it is convenient for the
Searcher of this sacred Science to know, that he may
see how all these things are done naturally, and bee
most easily understood. But it is most true, that
every compound thing in this world is subject to corruption,
and separation; which separation in the
Animall Kingdome is called death: And man seeing
hee is created and compounded of foure Elements,
how can hee bee immortall? It is hard to beleeve
that this is done naturally; but that there is something
above Nature in it. Yet God hath inspired it into
Philosophers that were good men many ages since,
that this is so naturally. Which take to be thus. Paradise
was, and is such a place, which was created by
the great Maker of all things, of true Elements, not
elementated, but most pure, temperate, equally proportioned
in the highest perfection; and all things
that were in Paradise were created of the same Elements,
and incorrupt; there also was Man created
and framed of the same incorrupted Elements, proportioned
in equality, that he could in no wise be corrupted,
therefore he was consecrated to immortality:
for without all doubt God created this Paradise for
men only, of which and where it is wee have largely
treated in our book of Harmony. But when afterwards
Man by his sinne of disobedience had transgressed
the comandement of the most High God, hee
was driven forth to beasts into the corruptible world
elementated, which God created only for beasts: who
of necessity, seeing he cannot live without nutriment,
must from corrupt elementated Elements receive
nutriment. By which nutriment those pure Elements
of which he was created, were infected; and so by little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
and little declined into corruption, untill one quality
exceeded another, and destruction, infirmity, and last
of all separation, and death of the whole compound
followed. So that now they are neer unto corruption
and death, who are procreated in corrupt Elements,
of corrupt Seed, and not in Paradise; for Seed
produced out of corrupt nutriments cannot be durable;
and by how much the longer it is since the driving
forth of man out of Paradise, so much the neerer
men are to corruption; and by consequence
their lives are so much shorter, and it will come
to this passe, that even generation it selfe by reason
of the shortnesse of life shall cease. Yet there
are some places, where the Aire is more favourable,
and the Starres more propitious, and there
their Natures are not so soon corrupted, because also
they live more temperately: Our Countrey-men by
reason of gluttony, and inordinate living make quick
hast to corruption. This experience teacheth, that
they that are born of the seed of infirme Parents doe
not live long. But if man had continued in Paradise,
a place sutable to his Nature, where all the
Elements were as incorrupt, and pure as a virgin, hee
had been immortall for ever. For it is certain that
when pure Elements are joined together equally in
their vertues, such a subject must be incorrupted, and
such must the Philosophers Stone bee: To this Creation
of Man the ancient Philosophers have likened
this Stone, but Modern Philosophers understanding
all things according to the letter doe apply it to the
corrupt generation of this age.</p>

<p>This Immortality was the chief cause that Philosophers
exercised their wits to find out this Stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
for they knew that man was created of such Elements
which were sound and pure. They therefore meditated
upon that Creation, which, when they knew
to bee naturall, began to search further into it, whether
such uncorrupted Elements could bee had, or if
they could be joined together, and infused into any
subject. Now to these the most High God, and Maker
of all things revealed, that a composition of such
Elements was in Gold: For in Animalls it could not
be had, seing they must preserve their lives by corrupt
Elements; in Vegetables also it is not, because in them
is found an inequality of the Elements. And seeing all
created things are inclined to multiplication, the Philosophers
propounded to themselves that they would
make tryall of the possibility of Nature in this Minerall
Kingdome; which being discovered, they saw
that there were innumerable other secrets in Nature,
of which, as of Divine secrets, they have wrote sparingly.
So now thou seest how corrupt Elements
come to bee in a subject, and how they are separated;
when one exceeds the other, and because then <span class="correction" title="In the original book: putrection">putrefaction</span>
is made by the first separation, and by putrefaction
is made a separation of the pure from the impure,
if then there be a new conjunction of them by vertue
of Fire, it doth acquire a form much more noble
then the first was. For in its first state, corruption was
by reason of grosse matter mixed with it, which is
not purged away but by putrefaction, the subject
thereby being bettered; and this could not be but by
the vertues of the foure Elements, which are in every
compound thing, being joined together: for when a
Compositum must perish, it perisheth by the Element
of Water; and whilest they lie thus confusedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
the Fire together with the Earth, and Aire which it
is in potentially, agree together, and by their united
forces do afterward overcome the Water, which they
digest, boile, and lastly congeal; and after this manner
Nature helps Nature. For if the hidden Central
Fire, which is the life of all things overcomes, and
works upon that which is neerer to it, and purer, as
it selfe is most pure, and is joined with it: so it overcomes
its contrary, and separates the pure from the
impure, and there is a new form generated, and if it
bee yet a little helped, much more excellent then the
former. Sometimes by the wit of a skilfull Artificer
there are made things immortall, especially in
the Minerall Kingdome. So all things are done by
Fire alone, and the government of Fire, and are
brought forth into a being, if thou hast understood
mee.</p>

<p>Here now thou hast the originall of the Elements,
their Natures, and operations described unto thee
very briefly, which is sufficient for our purpose in this
place. For otherwise if every Element were described
as it is, it would require a great volume not necessary
for our purpose. All those things, as wee said
before, wee refer to our book of Harmony, where
God willing, if wee live so long, wee shall write more
largely of Naturall things.</p>

<p>hese four Elements being described, we will
now descend unto the Principles of things.
But how they are produced of the foure
Elements, take it thus. After Nature
had received from the most high Creator of all things
the priviledge of being Princesse over this Monarchy
of the world, shee began to distribute places, and
Provinces to every thing, according to its dignity;
and in the first place shee made the Elements the Princes
of the world; and that the will of the most High
(in whose will Nature was placed) might be fulfilled,
she ordained that one should continually act upon the
other. The Fire therefore began to act upon the Aire,
and produced Sulphur, the Air also began to act upon
the Water, &amp; brought forth Mercury, the Water also
began to act upon the Earth, and brought forth Salt.
But the Earth, since it had nothing to work upon,
brought forth nothing, but that which was brought
forth continued, and abided in it: Wherefore there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
became only three Principles, and the Earth was
made the Nurse, and Mother of the rest. There were,
as wee said, three Principles brought forth; which the
ancient Philosophers did not so strictly consider, but
described only two actings of the Elements (or if
they were willingly silent in it, who shall censure
them, seeing they dedicated their writing only to the
Sons of Art?) and named them Sulphur, and Mercury,
which also may suffice us, to be the matter of Metals,
as also of the Philosophers Stone.</p>

<p>Whosoever therefore will bee a true Searcher of
this sacred Science must of necessity know the Accidents,
and an Accident it self, that hee may learn to
what subject, or Element hee purposeth to come to,
that through mediums hee may apply himselfe to
that, if otherwise hee desire to fill up the number of
four. For as these three Principles were produced of
four, so also by diminution must these three produce
two, Male, and Female; and two produce one
incorruptible thing, in which those foure shall being
equally perfect, be purified, and digested to the utmost;
and so a quadrangle shall answer a quadrangle.
And this is that quintessence, which is very necessary
for every Artificer, being separated from many
contraries. And so thou hast in these three Principles,
in what naturall composition soever, a body, a spirit,
and an occult soule; which three, if thou shalt joine
them together being separated, and well purified, as
wee said before, without doubt will by imitating Nature
yeeld most pure fruit. For although the soule be
taken from a most noble place, yet it cannot come
whither it tends but by a spirit, which is the place,
and mansion of the soule; which if thou wilt reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
to its due place, it is necessary that it be washed from
all its faults; and that the place be purified, that the
soule may be glorified in it, and never more be separated
from it. Now therefore thou hast the originall
of the three Principles, out of which it is thy part, by
imitating Nature, to produce the Mercury of Philosophers,
and their first matter, and to bring those
Principles of things, especially of Metalls to thy purpose:
seeing without those Principles it is impossible
for thee to perfect any thing by Art, since also Nature
her selfe can doe nor produce nothing without them.
These three are in all things, and without them there
is nothing in the world, or ever shall bee naturally.
But because wee said before, that the ancient Philosophers
named only two Principles, lest the Searcher
of the Art should erre, hee must know, that although
they did not describe any other but Sulphur, and
Mercury, yet without salt they could never have attained
to this work, since that is the key, and beginning
of this sacred Science: it is that, which openeth
the gates of Justice; it is that which hath the keyes
to the infernall prisons, where Sulphur lies bound, as
hereafter shal be more fully shewed in the third Treatise
of the Principles, of Salt.</p>

<p>Now to our purpose, which is that these 3 principles
are altogether necessary, because they are the neer
matter. For the matter of Metalls is twofold. Neer,
and remote. The neer is Sulphur, and Mercury. The
remote are the four Elements: out of which God
alone is able to create things. Leave therefore the
Elements, because of them thou shalt doe nothing;
neither canst thou out of them produce any
thing but these three Principles, seeing Nature her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
selfe can produce nothing else out of them. If therefore
thou canst out of the Elements produce nothing
but these three Principles, wherefore then is that
vaine labour of thine to seeke after, or to endeavour
to make that which Nature hath already made to
thy hands? Is it not better to goe three mile then
four? Let it suffice thee then to have three Principles,
out of which Nature doth produce all things
in the earth, and upon the earth; which three we find
to be entirely in every thing. By the due separation,
and conjunction of these, Nature produceth as well
Metalls, as Stones, in the Minerall Kingdome; but in
the Vegetable Kingdome Trees, Herbs, and all such
things; also in the Animall Kingdome the Body,
Spirit, and Soule, which especially doth resemble
the work of the Philosophers. The Body is Earth, the
Spirit is Water, the Soule is Fire, or the Sulphur of
Gold: The Spirit augmenteth the quantity of the
Body, but the Fire augmenteth the vertue thereof.
But because there is more of the Spirit in weight, then
is of the Fire; the Spirit is raised, and oppresseth the
Fire, and drawes it to it selfe: and so every one of
them, encreaseth in vertue, and the Earth, which is
the midle betwixt them encreaseth in weight. Let
therefore every searcher of this Art conclude in his
mind what he seeks for out of these three, and let him
assist it in the overcomeing of its contrary; and then
let him adde to the weight of Nature his weight, that
the defect of Nature may be made up by Art, that
shee may overcome what is contrary to her. We said
in the Element of Earth, that the Earth was nothing
else but the receptacle of other Elements, <i>i.e.</i> the subject
in which those two, Fire and Water, do strive, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
Aire mediating; if the Water be predominant, it
brings forth things that are corruptible, and continue
but for a time; but if the Fire overcome, it produceth
things that are lasting, &amp; incorruptible. Consider
therefore what is necessary for thee. Moreover
know, that Fire, and Water are in every thing, but
neither Fire, nor Water makes any thing, because
they only strive together, and contend concerning
swiftnesse, and vertue, and this not of themselves, but
by the excitation of the intrinsecall heat, which by
the motion of the heavenly vertues is kindled in the
Center of the Earth; without which those two could
never doe any thing, but would both stand still in
their own bound, and weight: but Nature afterward
joined them two together proportionably, and
then stirres them up by an intrinsecall heat, and so
they begin to contend one with the other, and each
of them will call to its help its like, and so they ascend
and encrease, untill the Earth can ascend no higher
with them; in the mean time those two by this retaining
of the Earth are subtilized; (for in that subject
of the Earth the Fire, and Water ascend incessantly,
and act through the pores which are reserved,
and which the Aire prepares) and out of their subtiliation
proceed flowers, and fruit, in which they become
friends, as you may see in Trees; for by how
much the better they are subtilized, and purified by
ascending, so much the better fruit doe they bring
forth, especially if they end with their vertues equally
joined together.</p>

<p>Now then the things being purged, and cleansed,
cause that the Fire, and Water bee made friends,
which will easily bee done in their own earth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
did ascend with them; and then thou shalt in a shorter
time perfect it, then Nature could, if thou shalt
joine them well together, according to the weight of
Nature, not as it was before, but as Nature requires,
and as is needfull: Because Nature in all compositions
puts more of the other Elements then of Fire:
alwaies the least part is Fire, but Nature according
as shee pleaseth, addes an extrinsecall Fire to stir up
that intrinsecall according to more, or lesse, in much,
or little time; and according to this if the Fire exceed,
or be exceeded, things perfect, or imperfect are made,
as well in Mineralls, as in Vegetables. The extrinsecall
Fire indeed doth not enter into the depth of
the composition essentially, but only in vertue; for
the intrinsecall materiall Fire is sufficient for it selfe, if
only it hath nourishment, and the extrinsecall Fire is
nourishment to it, and as it were Wood in respect of
Elementary Fire, and according to such a nourishment
it increaseth, and is multiplyed. Yet wee must
take heed that there bee not too much extrinsecall
Fire, for if any one eats more then hee is able, hee is
choaked: a great flame devours a little Fire: the extrinsecall
Fire must be multiplicative, nourishing, not
devouring, so things are perfected. Decoction therefore
in every thing is the perfection: so Nature addes
vertue, and weight, and makes perfect. But because it
is hard to adde to a compound, since it requires a long
labour, wee advise that thou take away so much of
that which is superfluous, as is needfull, and as
Nature requires: The superfluities being removed
mix them, then Nature will shew thee, what thou
hast sought after. Thou also shalt know, if Nature
hath joined the Elements well, or ill together, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
all Elements consist in conjunction. But many practitioners
sow Straw, for Wheat; and some both:
and many cast away that, which the Philosophers
love: some begin, and end, because of their inconstancy;
they seek for a difficult Art, and an easy labour;
they cast away the best things, &amp; sow the worst;
but as this Art is concealed in the Preface, so also is
the matter cast away in the beginning. Now wee
say, that this Art is nothing else, but the vertues of
the Elements equally mixed: it is a naturall equality
of hot, dry, cold, moist; A joining together of Male,
and Female, which the same Female begot, <i>i.e.</i> a
conjunction of Fire, and the radicall moisture of Metalls.
By considering that the Mercury of Philosophers
hath in it selfe its owne good Sulphur, more or
lesse, depurated, and decocted by Nature, thou maist
perfect all things out of Mercury: but if thou shalt
know to adde thy weights to the weights of Nature,
to double Mercury, and triple Sulphur, it will quickly
be terminated in good, then in better, untill into best
of all: although there be but one appearing Sulphur,
and two Mercuries, but of one root; not crude, nor
too much boiled, yet purged, and dissolved, if thou
hast understood mee.</p>

<p>It is not needfull to describe the matter of the Mercury
of Philosophers, and the matter of their Sulphur:
no mortall man ever could, or ever hereafter
shall bee able to describe it more openly, and cleerly
then it hath already been described, and named by
the Ancient Philosophers, unlesse he will bee an Anathema
of the Art. For is so commonly named,
that truly it is not esteemed of, therefore doe Students
of this Art bend their minds rather to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
subtilties, then abide in the simplicity of Nature. We
doe not yet say, that Mercury of Philosophers is a
common thing, and openly named, but the matter
of which Philosophers doe make their Sulphur, and
Mercury: for the Mercury of Philosophers is not to
be had of it selfe upon the Earth, but it is brought
forth by Art out of Sulphur, and Mercury joined together;
it doth not come forth into light, for it is naked,
but yet is covered by Nature in a wonderful manner.
To conclude, we say with repeating Sulphur, and
Mercury to be the Mine of our Quicksilver (but being
joined together) that Quicksilver can dissolve
Metalls, kill them, and make them alive, which
power it receiveth from that sharp Sulphur, which is
of its own nature. But that thou maist yet better conceive
it, hearken to me whilst I tell thee the difference
which is betwixt our Quicksilver, and common
Quicksilver, or Mercury. Common Mercury doth
not dissolve Gold, and Silver so, that it cannot be separated
from them; but our Argent vive doth dissolve
Gold, and Silver, and is never separated from them,
but is as Water mixed with Water. Common Mercury
hath combustible evill Sulphur, with which it is
made black: but our Argent vive hath in it incombustible
Sulphur, fixed, good, white, and red. Common
Mercury is cold, and moist, our Mercury is hot,
and moist. Common Mercury makes bodies black,
and stains them: our Argent vive makes bodies as
white as Crystall. Common Mercury is turned by
precipitation into a Citrine powder, and an evill Sulphur:
our argent vive by vertue of heat, into most white
Sulphur, good, fixed, and fluxible. Common Mercury
by how much the more it is decocted, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
fluxible it is: our Argent vive, by how much the
more it is decocted, the more it is thickned. By these
circumstances therefore thou maist consider how the
Common Mercury differs from the Mercury of Philosophers.
If thou dost not yet understand, do not
expect it, for no mortall man will ever speake more
plainly, and cleerly, then wee have done: but now
of the vertues of it. Our Argent vive is of such vertue,
that it is of it self sufficient for thee, and for it self
without any addition of any extraneous thing, it is
dissolved, and congealed by a naturall decoction only:
but Philosophers for brevities sake adde to it its
own Sulphur well digested, and ripened, and so they
work.</p>

<p>Wee could cite the Writings of Philosophers to
confirm what we have said; but because we have wrote
clearer things then are in their Writings, they need
not any confirmation, he shall understand who looks
into other mens writings. If therefore thou wilt follow
our advice, Wee advise thee, that before thou
settest thy self to this Art, in the first place thou learn
to hold thy tongue, and that thou inquire into the
Nature of Mines, and Metalls, as also of Vegetables,
for thou shalt find our Mercury in every subject,
and from all things the Mercury of Philosophers
may bee extracted, although it be neerer in one subject,
then in another. Know also for certain, that this
Art is not placed in fortune, or casuall invention, but
in a reall Science, and that there is but this one matter
in the world, by which, and of which the Philosophers
Stone is made. It is indeed in all things, but
in extracting of it a mans life would fail, and not be
sufficient. Yet without the knowledge of naturall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
things, especially in the Minerall Kingdome, thou
shalt be like a blind man that walketh by use. Truly
such a one seeks after the Art but casually; and although,
as it oftentimes falls out, that a man may
by chance fall upon the matter of our Argent vive,
yet then he ends the worke when hee should begin;
and so as hee found it out casually, hee loseth it casually,
because hee knows not upon what hee should
ground his intention. Therefore this Art is the gift
of the most high God: and unlesse God reveales it
by means of a good wit, or friend, it is hardly known:
for wee cannot bee all as <i>Geber</i>, nor as <i>Lullius</i>:
And although <i>Lullius</i> was a man of a subtill wit, yet
if hee had not received the Art from <i>Arnoldus</i>, certainly
hee had been like unto those which find the
Art with difficulty: So also <i>Arnoldus</i> confesseth that
hee received it of a friend. For it is easy to write
what Nature dictates: It is a Proverb, <i>It is easy to
adde to things already found out</i>. Every Art, and
Science is easy to the Master, but to a young Scholar
not so: and to find out this Art there is a long
time required, many vessells, great expence, and
continuall labour, with much meditation, although
to him that knows it already all things are easy, and
light. To conclude therefore wee say, that this Art is
the gift of God alone, which being known, he must
also bee prayed to that he would give his blessing to
the Art; for without this divine blessing it would be
of no use, and unprofitable, which wee our selves
have had experience of, seeing wee have by reason of
this Art undergone great dangers, yea wee have had
more mischief, and misfortune by it, then advantage:
but there is a time when men are wise too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The judgements of the Lord are a great depth. Yet
I admired at divine providence in these my misfortunes:
for I alwaies had the protection of our great
Creator alwaies at hand, that no enemie could bee
too hard for me, or represse mee. The Angell of the
Lord of this Treasury hath alwaies been my Keeper,
into which Treasury the most High Creator hath
shut close this treasure only, which hee will alwaies
defend, and secure. For I have heard that my Enemies
have fell into that snare which they laid for mee.
They which would have taken away my life have lost
their own; and some of them which would have
taken away my goods have lost Kingdomes: Moreover,
I know many that would have detracted from
my good name, have perished with disgrace. So great
preservation have I alwaies had from the great Creator
of all things, who presently took mee from my
Mothers wombe, put mee under the shadow of his
wings, and infused the Spirit of understanding all
naturall things, to whom be praise, and glory, for
ever, and ever. So great blessings have I received
from the most High God our Creator, that it is
impossible not only for my pen, but my mind to
comprehend. God scarce ever conferred upon any
mortall man greater things, yea scarce so great. I wish
I had so much affections, so much spirit, eloquence,
and wisdome, that I might render meet thankes to
him; for I know wee have not deserved so great
things, only this I beleeve my selfe to bee, that in
him alone I have alwaies trusted, doe trust, and
shall trust. For I know that there is no mortall man
is able to help mee, only this God, and our Creator;
for it is a vain thing to trust in Princes, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
are men (as saith the <i>Psalmist</i>) and that all these have
their breath of life from God, and this being taken
away they are dust; but it is a safe, and secure thing
to trust in the Lord God, from whom as from the
fountain of goodnesse all good things doe most abundantly
flow. Thou therefore that desirest to attaine
to this Art, in the first place put thy whole trust in
God thy Creator, and urge him by thy prayers, and
then assuredly beleeve that hee will not forsake thee:
for if God shall know that thy heart is sincere, and
thy whole trust is put in him, hee will by one means
or another shew thee a way, and assist thee in it, that
thou shalt obtain thy desire. The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdome. Pray, but yet worke:
God indeed gives understanding, but thou must know
how, and when to use it: for as a good understanding,
and a good opportunity are the gifts of God, so also is
the punishment of sinne, when a good opportunity is
omitted. But to return to our purpose; wee say, that
Argent vive is the first matter of that work, and truly
nothing else; whatsoever is added to it, ariseth from
it. Wee have said oftentimes that all things in the
world are made, and generated of the three Principles;
but wee purge some things from their accidents,
and being purged, joine them together againe; and
by adding what is to be added, wee supply what is
defective, and by imitating Nature, wee boile them
to the highest degree of perfection, which Nature
could by reason of Accidents never doe, and so ended
where Art must begin. Moreover, if thou desirest to
imitate Nature, imitate her in those things, in which
shee workes. And let it not trouble thee that our
Writings seem to contradict one another in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
places; for so it must bee, lest the Art be too plainly
disclosed: But do thou make choice of those things
which agree with Nature, take the roses, and leave
the prickles. If thou dost intend to make a Metall,
let a Metall be thy ground work, because of a Dog is
generated nothing but a Dog, and of Metall, nothing
but a Metall: for know for certain, if thou shalt not
take out of Metall the radicall moisture, well separated,
thou shalt never doe any thing; without grains of
Wheat thou shalt till thy ground in vain: there is but
one thing, but one Art, but one operation. If therefore
thou wilt produce a Metall, thou shalt ferment
with a Metall; and if thou wilt produce a Tree, let
the seed of the Tree be thy ferment. There is as we
said, but one operation, and beside it there is none
other that is true. All they therefore are mistaken
that say, that any particular thing, besides this one
way, and naturall matter is true; for a bough is not
to bee had, but from the trunk of a Tree: It is an impossible,
and senselesse thing to go about to produce
a bough; it is easier to make the Elixir it selfe, then
any particular thing, although most simple, that will
bee advantageous, and abide a naturall examination,
and tryall. Yet there bee many that boast they can
fix Silver, but it were better for them if they could
fix Lead, or Tinne, seeing in my judgement it is all
one labour, because they doe not resist the tryall of
the fire, whilest they abide in their own nature; but
Silver is in its nature fixed enough, and needs not any
Sophisticall fixation. But seeing there are as many
opinions, as men, wee will leave every one to his
own opinion: Let him that will not follow our
counsell, and imitate Nature, continue in his errour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
Indeed <span class="correction" title="In the original book: prrticulars">particulars</span> may easily bee made, if you have
a Tree, whose young twigs may bee graffed into
divers trees; as if you have one water, divers kinds
of flesh may be boiled in it, and according to the diversity
of the flesh the broth hath its tast, and this
from the same foundation. Wee conclude therefore
that there is but one Nature, as well in Metalls as in
other things, but her operation is various; also there
is one universall matter according to <i>Hermes</i>. <i>So
from this one thing all things proceed.</i> Yet there bee
many Artificers, who follow every one his own fancy.
They seek a new Nature, and new matter; and in conclusion
they find a new nothing, because they interpret
the Writings of Philosophers not according to
the possibility of Nature, but the letter. But all these
are of that Assembly, of which mention hath been
made in the Dialogue of Mercury with the Alchymist,
who return home without any Conclusion;
they looke after the end, without any medium, or
indeed beginning; and the reason of this is, because
they endeavour not to attain to the Art out of the
Principles, and grounds of Philosophers, and reading
of the books of Philosophers, but from reports, and
receipts of Mountebankes: (although now indeed
the books of Philosophers are perhaps destroyed by
the envious, by adding in some places, and detracting
in others) afterwards when things doe not succeed,
they betake themselves to Sophistications, and assay
divers vaine operations, by making whites, by
making reds, by fixing Silver, and extracting out
the soul of Gold; which in the Preface of the booke
of the Twelve Treatises hath been sufficiently denyed.
We doe not deny, yea, we doe say that it is al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>together
necessary, that the Metallick soule bee extracted,
but not for any Sophisticall operation, but
for the Philosophicall work, which being extracted,
and purged, must againe bee restored to its owne
body, that there may bee a true resurrection of a
glorified body. This was never our purpose, to
be able to multiply Wheat without the seed of
Wheate, but that that extracted soul bee able in a
Sophisticall way to tinge another Metall, know
that it is a thing most false, and that all those
that boast of doing of it, are Cheaters: but of
that more fully in the third Principle of Salt,
since here is not place for any further Discourse.</p>

<p>he Philosophers have not undeservedly
placed Sulphur in the first place amongst
the three Principles, as being the most
worthy Principle, in the knowledge of
which the whole Art consists. Now there is a threefold
Sulphur, and that is to be chosen above the rest:
a Sulphur tinging, or colouring: a Sulphur congealing
Mercury: the third is essentiall, and ripening. Of
which we ought to treat seriously, but because we have
set forth one of the Principles by way of Dialogue, so
also wee shall conclude the rest, lest we should seem
to be partiall, and detract from either of them. Sulphur
is more mature then any of the other Principles,
and Mercury is not coagulated but by Sulphur:
therefore our whole operation in this Art is nothing
else but to know how to draw forth that Sulphur out
of Metalls, by which our Argent vive in the bowels
of the Earth is congealed into Gold, and Silver:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
which Sulphur indeed is in this work in stead of the
Male, but the Mercury in stead of the Female. Of
the composition, and acting of these two are generated
the Mercuries of Philosophers.</p>

<p>Wee told you in the Dialogue of Mercury with the
Alchymist, of an Assembly of Alchymists that were
met together to consult out of what matter, and how
the Philosophers Stone is to be made, and how that
by the misfortune of a tempest they were without
any conclusion dispersed almost through the whole
world. For there arose a strong tempest, and very
great wind, which dispersed them all abroad, and so
blowed through some of their heads, that till this
time they cannot yet recover themselves, by meanes
of which divers sort of worms are bred in their
brains. Now there were amongst them men of divers
opinions, and conditions, and among the rest there
was this Alchymist, which in this Treatise I shall
discourse of: hee was otherwise a good man, but
without a Conclusion, or unresolved, also of the
number of those, who propound to themselves to
find out the Philosophers Stone casually, and he was
companion to that Philosopher, who disputed with
Mercury. Now this man said, if it had been my
fortune to have spoke with Mercury, I should have
fished him dry in few words; that other, saith hee,
was a foole, hee knew not how to proceed with him.
Mercury indeed never pleased mee, neither indeed do
I think there is any good in it; but I approve of Sulphur,
because at that meeting wee discoursed most
excellently of it: if that tempest had not disturbed
us, wee had concluded that that had been the first
matter, for I am not wont to trouble my selfe with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
light, and triviall matters, my head is full of profound
imaginations. And so being full of confidence
hee resolves to work in Sulphur, hee began therefore
to distill it, to sublime, calcine, to fix it, to make oyle
<i>per Campanam</i> of it, sometimes by itselfe, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: somemes">sometimes</span>
with Crystals, and Egge-shels, and hee tryed
divers other operations about it: and when hee had
spent much time and costs, and could find nothing
to his purpose, he was sad, and being in a miserable
perplexity passed over many nights without sleep;
also oftentimes hee went forth out of the City, to
behold things, that hee might the more conveniently
devise something that was certain in his operation:
Now it fell out upon a time, as he was walking up
and down, hee fell into an extasy with beholding of
things, and came unto a certain green Wood, very
full of all manner of things; in which were Mines of
all Mineralls, and Metalls, and all kinds of beasts, and
birds, and abundance of Trees, Herbs, and fruit: there
also were divers conduits of water, for in those places
there was no water to be had, but what was brought
thither by divers instruments, and pipes, and this by
divers Artificers from divers places: that was the
chiefest, and clearer then the rest, which was drawne
by the beams of the Moon; and this was procured
only for the Nymph of the Wood. There also did
feed Bulls, and Rams, and the Shepheards were
two young men, whom the Alchymist asking, said,
Whose Wood is this? whom they answered saying,
This is the Wood, and Garden of our Nymph
<i>Venus</i>. The Alchymist walks up, and down in it: and
the place pleased him well, but yet hee did still think
of his Sulphur; and so being weary of walking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
in a sad condition sate by the side of the channel, under
a certain tree; and began to lament most miserably,
bewailing his time, and charges, which he spent in vain
with operating (he could not els have deceived others,
but have damnified himself only) and said, What is
this, all men say it is a thing common, of small esteem,
easy, and I am a learned man, &amp; I cannot find out this
wretched Stone. And so in his lamentation he began
to curse Sulphur, because he had spent so much cost,
and labour in vain upon him: and Sulphur also was
in that Wood, but this was unknown to the Alchymist.
Whilst he was thus lamenting, he heard this voice
as it were of some old man: Friend, Why dost thou
curse Sulphur? The Alchymist looked every way
round about him, and seeing no body, was afraid.
But that voice said to him again, Friend why art
thou so sad? The Alchymist taking courage, said,
Sir, The hungry man is alwaies thinking upon bread,
so doe I alwaies upon the Philosophers Stone. <i>Vox</i>,
And why dost thou curse Sulphur? <i>Alch.</i> Sir, I beleeved
that that was the first matter of the Philosophers
Stone, and therefore in working upon it many years,
I spent much, and could not find that Stone. <i>Vox.</i>
Friend, truly I know that Sulphur is the true, and
principall subject of the Philosophers Stone, but I
know not thee, nor any thing of thy labour, and intention:
thou dost without cause curse Sulphur; because
he is in cruell prisons, and cannot be at hand to every
body; seeing hee is put bound in a most dark dungeon,
and goes not forth, but whither his Keepers carry
him. <i>Alch.</i> And why is he imprisoned? <i>Vox.</i> Because
hee would bee obedient to every Alchymist,
and doe what they would have him, contrary to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
Mothers will, who forbad him to obey any, but
such as knew her, wherefore shee put him into prison,
and commanded that his feet should be bound, and
set Keepers over him, that without their knowledg,
and pleasure hee should goe no whither. <i>Alch.</i> O
wretch! for this reason hee could not come to mee:
truly his Mother doth him great wrong: and when
shall hee bee let out of those prisons? <i>Vox</i>, O friend!
The Sulphur of Philosophers cannot goe forth hence
but in a long time, and with a great deale of labour.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir! And who be his Keepers that keep him?
<i>Vox</i>, Friend! His Keepers are of the same stocke, but
Tyrants. <i>Alch.</i> And who art thou, and how art
thou called? <i>Vox</i>, I am Judge, and Governour of the
prisons, and my name is <i>Saturne</i>. <i>Alch.</i> Then Sulphur
is kept in thy prisons. <i>Vox</i>, Sulphur indeed is
kept in my prisons, but hee hath other Keepers. <i>Alch.</i>
And what doth hee doe in the prisons? <i>Vox</i>, He doth
whatsoever his Keepers will have him. <i>Alch.</i> And
what can hee doe? <i>Vox</i>, Hee is the maker of a thousand
things, and is the heart of all things; hee knows
how to make Metalls better, and corrects Mineralls,
teacheth Animalls understanding, knowes how to
make all kind of Flowers in Hearbs, and Trees, and
is chief over them, corrupts the Aire, which hee
amends again: hee is the Maker of all Odours, and
Painter of all Colours. <i>Alch.</i> Out of what matter
doth hee make Flowers? <i>Vox</i>, His Keepers afford
matter, and vessells, but Sulphur digests the matter,
and according to the variety of his digestion, and
weight, various Flowers, and Odours are produced.
<i>Alch.</i> Is hee old? <i>Vox</i>, Friend, Know that Sulphur
is the vertue of all things, and is the second by birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
but yet older then all things, stronger, and more worthy,
yet an obedient child. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, How is hee
known? <i>Vox</i>, Divers wayes, but best by the State
of the Vitalls in Animalls, by the colour in Metalls,
by the odour in Vegetables: without him his Mother
works nothing. <i>Alch.</i> Is hee the sole heir, or hath
hee brethren? <i>Vox</i>, His Mother hath but only one
son like him, his other brethren are associated with evil
things, hee hath a sister which he loves, and is againe
beloved by her, for shee is as it were a Mother to
him. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, is hee every where uniform? <i>Vox</i>,
According to his Nature, but hee is changed in
the prisons; yet his heart is alwaies pure, but his garments
are stained. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, Was hee ever at liberty?
<i>Vox</i>, Yea, especially in those times when
there were such wise men, betwixt whom, and his
Mother there was great familiarity, and friendship.
<i>Alch.</i> And who were they? <i>Vox</i>, There were very
many: There was <i>Hermes</i>, who was <span class="correction" title="In the original book: at">as</span> it were one
with his Mother: After him were many Kings, and
Princes, as also many other wise men, in ages since, as
<i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Avicen</i>, &amp;c. who set him at liberty: These
knew how to unloose his bonds. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, What
did hee give them for setting of him at liberty? <i>Vox</i>,
Hee gave them three Kingdomes: for when any
doth unbind him, and releaseth him, then he overcomes
his Keepers, which before did govern in his
Kingdome, and delivers them being bound to him
that released him, for to bee his subjects, and gives
him their Kingdomes to possesse: but that, which is
more; in his Kingdome is a Looking-glasse, in which
is seen the whole world. Whosoever lookes in this
Glasse may see, and learn in it three parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
wisdome of the whole world, and so shall become
very wise in these three Kingdomes, such were <i>Aristotle</i>,
<i>Avicen</i>, and many others, who as well as
they before them, saw in this glasse how the
world was made: By this they learned what were the
influences of the Celestiall vertues upon inferiour
bodies, and how Nature by the weight of Fire
compounds things; as also the motion of the Sun,
and Moon: especially that universall motion, by
which his Mother is governed: by this they knew
the degrees of heat, cold, moisture, drynesse, and
the vertues of hearbs, and indeed of all things,
whence they became most excellent Physitians.
And truly, unlesse a Physitian be such a one as knows,
why this hearb, or that, is hot, dry, or moist in this
degree, not out of the books of <i>Galen</i>, or <i>Avicen</i>,
but out of the originall of Nature, from whence
they also understood these things, hee cannot bee a
well grounded Physitian. All these things they diligently
considered, and bequeathed their Writings to
their successors, that men might bee stirred up to studies
of a higher Nature, and learn how to set Sulphur
at liberty, and unloose his bonds: but men of
this age take their Writings for a sufficient ground,
and authority, and seek no further; and it sufficeth
them if they know how to say, So saith <i>Aristotle</i>, or;
Thus saith <i>Galen</i>. <i>Alch.</i> And what say you, Sir, Can
an herb bee known without an Herball? <i>Vox</i>, Those
ancient Philosophers wrote their Receipts out of the
very Fountain of Nature. <i>Alch.</i> How Sir? <i>Vox</i>, Know
that all things in the earth, and upon the earth, are
generated, and produced of three Principles; sometimes
of two, to which the third is joined: he there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>fore
that knows these three Principles; and the
weight of them, how Nature joins them together,
may be easily able by decoction to understand the
degree of Fire in the subject, whether well, or ill,
or indifferently decocted, and that according to
more or lesse: For all Vegetable things are known
by those, who know the three Principles. <i>Alch.</i>
And how is this done? <i>Vox</i>, By sight, tast, and
smell; in, and from these three senses are gathered
the three Principles of things, and the degrees of
their digestions. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, They say that Sulphur
is a Medicine. <i>Vox</i>, Yea, and the Physitian himselfe,
and to them that set him free from prison, by
way of thankfulnesse hee gives his blood for a Medicine.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, the universall Medicine being
had, how long may a man preserve himselfe from
death? <i>Vox</i>, Even to the term of death: but this
Medicine must bee taken cautiously, for many wise
men have been destroyed by it before their time.
<i>Alch.</i> And what say you Sir, Is it poison? <i>Vox</i>, Hast
not thou heard that a great flame of fire destroyes a
little one? There were many Philosophers, which
received the Art from other mens experience, which
did not so throughly search into the vertue of the
Medicine; yea, by how much the more powerfull,
subtiler the Medicine was, it seemed to them to bee
the more wholsome; and if one grain of it can passe
through many thousands of Metalls, much more
Mans body. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, How then must it be used?
<i>Vox</i>, It must bee so used, that it may strengthen
the Naturall heat, but not overcome it. <i>Alch.</i> Sir,
I know how to make such a Medicine. <i>Vox</i>, Thou
art happy if thou dost know. For the blood of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
Sulphur is that intrinsecall vertue, and siccity that
turnes, and congeals Quicksilver, and all Metalls
into Gold, and Mens bodies into health. <i>Alch.</i> Sir,
I know how to make oyle of Sulphur, which is prepared
with calcined Crystalls; I know also another,
which is done by a Bell. <i>Vox</i>, Certainly then thou
art a Philosopher of that Assembly; for thou dost
understand, and expound my words aright, as also,
unlesse I am deceived, of all the Philosophers.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, Is not this oyle the blood of Sulphur?
<i>Vox</i>, O Friend! the blood of Sulphur is not given
to any but to those, who know how to set him free
from prison. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, doth Sulphur know any
thing in the Metalls? <i>Vox</i>, I told thee, that hee
knows all things, and especially in Metalls, but his
Keepers know that there he could bee easily set at
liberty, wherefore they keep him there bound fast in
most strong prisons, so that hee cannot breath, and
they are afraid lest hee should come into the Kings
palace. <i>Alch.</i> Is hee imprisoned so in all Metalls?
<i>Vox</i>, In all; but not alike, in some not so strictly.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, And why in Metalls in such a tyrannicall
manner? <i>Vox</i>, Because hee would stand in awe of
them no longer, when hee shall once come to his
Kingly palaces, for then hee can be seen, and looke
freely out of the windows; because there he is in his
proper Kingdome, although not yet as hee desires.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, and what doth hee eat? <i>Vox</i>, His meat
is wind, when hee is at liberty, it is decocted; but in
prison hee is constrained to eat it raw. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, Can
those enmities betwixt him and his Keepers bee reconciled?
<i>Vox</i>, Yes, if any one were so wise. <i>Alch.</i>
Why doth not he treat with them concerning a paci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>fication?
<i>Vox</i>, That hee cannot doe by himselfe,
because presently hee waxeth hot with anger, and
rage. <i>Alch.</i> Let him doe it by a Commissioner.
<i>Vox</i>, Certainly hee would bee the most happy man
in the world, and worthy of eternall memory,
who could tell how to make peace betwixt them;
but this no man can doe but hee that is very wise,
and can agree with his Mother, and have co-intelligence
with her: for if they were friends, one would
not hinder the other, but joining their forces together
would make things immortall. Truely hee
that would reconcile them together would bee a
man worthy to be consecrated to eternity. <i>Alch.</i> Sir,
I will compose those differences betwixt them, and
free him, I am in other matters a man very learned,
and wise: Besides, I am very good at operations.
<i>Vox</i>, Friend, I see truly that thou art big enough,
and thou hast a great head, but I know not whether
thou canst doe those things or no. <i>Alch.</i> Sir,
Perhaps thou art ignorant of what the Alchymists
know, in matter of treaty they have alwaies
the better of it, and truly I am not the last, so that
his enemies will but treat with mee, if they will
treat, assure your selfe that they will have the worst.
Sir, beleeve mee, the Alchymists know how to treat,
if they only will but treat with mee, Sulphur shall
presently be at liberty. <i>Vox</i>, I like your judgement
well, I hear that you are approved of. <i>Alch.</i> Sir,
Tell mee if this bee the true Sulphur of the Philosophers?
<i>Vox</i>, This truely is Sulphur, but whether
it be the Philosopher, that belongs to thee to know.
I have said enough to thee concerning Sulphur.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, If I can find his prisons, shall I bee able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
to set him at liberty? <i>Vox</i>, If thou knowest well,
thou shalt; for it is easier to free him then find them.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, I beseech thee tell mee but this, if I find
him, shal I make the Philosophers stone of him? <i>Vox</i>,
O Friend! It is not for mee to judge, doe thou
look to that, yet if thou knowest his Mother, and
followest her, Sulphur being at liberty, the Stone is
at hand. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, in what subject is this Sulphur?
<i>Vo.</i> Know for certain that this Sulphur is of great
vertue, his Mine are all things in the world, for hee
is in Metalls, Hearbs, Trees, Animalls, Stones, and
Mineralls. <i>Alch.</i> And what Devill is able to find him
out lying hid amongst so many things, and subjects?
Tell mee the matter out of which the Philosophers
take him. <i>Vo.</i> Friend, thou comest too neer, yet that
I may satisfie thee, know that Sulphur is every where,
but shee hath some certaine palaces, where shee is
wont to give audience to the Philosophers; but the
Philosophers adore him swimming in his owne sea,
and playing with Vulcan; when the Philosophers goe
to him unknown in his vile garments. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, in
the sea, why then is hee not mine, since hee is hid
here so neer? <i>Vo.</i> I told thee that his Keepers put him
into most dark prisons, lest thou shouldst see him, for
hee is in one subject alone, but if thou hast not found
him at home, thou wilt scarce find him in the Woods.
But doe not thou despaire in finding of him out:
I tell thee of a truth, that hee is in Gold, and Silver
most perfect, but in Argent vive most easy.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, I would very willingly make the Philosophers
Stone. <i>Vo.</i> Thou desirest a good thing, Sulphur
also would willingly bee out of bonds. And so <i>Saturn</i>
departed. Now a deep sleep seased upon the Al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>chymist,
being weary, and there appeared to him
this Vision, Hee saw in that Wood a fountain full
of water, about which walked Sal, and Sulphur, contending
one with the other, untill at last they began
to fight; and Sal gave Sulphur an incurable wound,
out of which wound, in stead of blood, there came
out water, as it were most white milk, and it became
to be a great river. Then out of that Wood came
forth <i>Diana</i> a most beautifull Virgin, who began to
wash her self in that river: whom a certain Prince, a
most stout man (and greater then his servants) passing
by, and seeing, began to admire at her beauty; and
because shee was of a like nature with him, hee became
enamoured with her, which when she perceived,
shee was inflamed with love towards him.
Wherefore as it were falling into a swoun she began
to be drowned: which that Prince seeing, commanded
his servants to help her; but they were all afraid
to goe to the river; to whom the Prince said, Why
doe you not help <i>Diana</i> that Virgin? To whom they
replyed, Sir, this river is indeed little, and as it were
dryed up, but most dangerous: Once upon a time
wee were willing to go into it without thy knowledge,
and wee hardly escaped the danger of eternall death;
Wee know also that others that were our predecessors
perished in it. Then the Prince himselfe laying
aside his thick mantle, even as hee was armed, leaped
into the river, and to help faire <i>Diana</i> hee stretched
forth his hand to her; who being willing to save her
selfe, drew also the Prince himselfe to her, and so
were both drowned. A little after their souls came
out of the river, flying above the river, and said, It
was well done of us, for else wee could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
been freed from those bodies which are polluted, and
stained. <i>Alch.</i> But doe you ever return into those
bodies againe? <i>Anime</i>, Not into such filthy bodies,
but when they be purged, and this river shall bee
throughly dryed up by the heat of the sunne, and this
Province shall bee often tryed by the Aire. <i>Alch.</i>
What shall you doe in the mean time. <i>Anim.</i> Here
wee shall fly upon the river till those clouds, and
tempests shall cease. In the mean time the Alchymist
fell into a more desired dream of his Sulphur; and
behold there appeared to him many Alchymists
coming to that place to seek after Sulphur, and when
they found the carkasse of that Sulphur that was
slain by Sal by the fountain, they divided it amongst
themselves: which when the Alchymist saw hee also
took a part with them; and so every one of them
returned home, and began to work in that Sulphur,
and till this day they doe not give over. But <i>Saturne</i>
meets this Alchymist, and saith to him, Friend, how
is it with thee? <i>Alch.</i> O Sir, I have seen many wonderfull
things, my wife would scarce beleeve them;
now also I have found Sulphur, I beseech you Sir
help, let us make the Philosophers Stone. <i>Saturnus.</i>
With all my heart, my friend, make ready then
Argent-vive, and Sulphur, and give hither a glasse.
<i>Alch.</i> Sir, have nothing to doe with Mercury, for he
is naught, he hath deluded my companion, and many
others. <i>Sat.</i> Without Argent-vive, in whose Kingdome
Sulphur is the King, the Philosophers have
done nothing, neither doe I know what to doe without
it. <i>Alch.</i> Sir, Let us make it of Sulphur alone. <i>Sat.</i>
Well then, my friend, but it will succeed accordingly.
Then they took that Sulphur, which the Alchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>mist
found, and they did what the Alchymist would
have done, they began to work divers ways, and to
make experiments of Sulphur in divers strange kind
of furnaces, which the Alchymist had: but in the
conclusion of every operation there was brought
forth nothing but Matches, such as old women usually
sell to light candles withall. Then they began a
new work, and sublimed, and calcined Sulphur according
to the Alchymists pleasure; but in what way
soever they worked it, it succeeded as before, for still
they made nothing but Matches; then said the
Alchymist to Saturn, Truly Sir, I see it will not
succeed according to my fancy, I beseech thee doe
thou work alone, what thou knowest. Then Saturn
said, See then, and learn. Hee then took two Mercuries
of a differing substance, but of one originall,
which Saturn washed in his owne urine, and called
them Sulphurs of Sulphurs, and mixed the fixed
with the volatile, and the composition being made,
hee put it into its proper vessell, and lest the Sulphur
should fly away, hee set a keeper over him, and then
put him into a bath of a most gentle heat, according
as the matter required, and hee made all things very
well. Then they made the Philosophers Stone, because
of the true matter a true thing must needs bee
made. The Alchymist being very glad took the Stone
with the glasse, and beholding the colour thereof,
which was like burnt blood, hee was amazed, and
by reason of too much joy hee began to leap, in
which leaping the glasse fell out of his hands upon
the ground, and was broken. And so Saturn vanished
away. The Alchymist also being awaked out of
his dream, found nothing in his hands but Matches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
which hee made of brimstone: but the Stone flew
away, and doth still fly; whence it is called Volatile:
and so that miserable Alchymist learned nothing else
by that Vision but how to make Matches: who afterwards
laying aside the Stone, became to be a Physitian;
by searching after the stone of the Philosophers
hee got the stone of the Kidneys. Last of all hee
led such a life, as such kind of Alchymists are wont
to doe, who for the most part become Physitians, or
Quacksalvers, which thing will happen to all, who
betake themselves to the Art casually without any
foundation, but only by hearesay, or by meanes of
Receipts.</p>

<p>Some of them, when things succeed not, say: We
are wise men, wee hear that the grasse grows, if the
Art were true wee should have had it before other
men: And so having brazen faces, lest wee should
bee accounted undeserving men (as indeed they are,
and also perverse) contemne, and undervalue the
Art. This Science hates such men, and alwaies
shews them the beginning in the end. Now we grant
unto the unworthy, that this Art is nothing, but to
the Lovers of vertue, and the true Searchers, and
Sons of Wisdome, wee doe most highly commend
it, and doe affirme it not only to be true, but altogether
the truest: which, sometimes wee have really
made good before men worthy of such a fight,
I say before men of high, and low condition: (yet
this Medicine was not made by us, but received
from a friend, and yet most true) for the searching
out of which wee have sufficiently instructed the
Searchers thereof; whom if our Writings doe not
please, let them read those of other Authors, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
are easier, but with this Caution, That whatsoever
they shall read, they shall alwaies compare
it with the possibility of Nature, lest they assay
any thing contrary to Nature. Neither let them
beleeve, although it were written in the bookes of
Philosophers, that Fire burns not, because this is
contrary to Nature: but if it bee writ, that Fire
hath a drying, and heating faculty, this is to bee
beleeved, because it is according to Nature: For Nature
doth alwaies agree with a sound judgment, and in
Nature there is nothing difficult, all truth is plain.
Then also let them learne, what things in Nature
are of affinity with each other, which wee conceive
may be easier done by our Writings, then any
other, seeing wee think wee have wrote sufficiently,
untill some other shall come, who shall set
downe the whole Receipt so plaine, as to make
cheese of Milke, which is not lawfull for us to
doe.</p>

<p>But that I may not direct all things I say to the
new beginner only, wee shall say something to you
also who now have passed over these painfull labours.
Have you seen that Countrey, where a
man marryed a wife, whose nuptialls were celebrated
in the house of Nature? Have you understood
how the vulgar with you have seen this Sulphur? If
therefore you will that old women should practise
your Philosophy, shew the dealbation of your Sulphurs;
say unto the vulgar, Come and see, for now
the water is divided, and Sulphur is come out; hee
will return white, and congeale the Waters. Burn
therefore Sulphur from incombustible Sulphur, then
wash it, make it white, and red, untill Sulphur be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>come
Mercury, and Mercury bee made <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Suphur">Sulphur</span>,
which afterwards you shall beautifie with the soule
of Gold: For if you doe not sublime Sulphur,
from Sulphur, and Mercury from Mercury, you
have not yet found out the Water, which out of
Sulphur, and Mercury is created by way of distillation;
hee doth not ascend, that doth not descend.
Whatsoever in this Art is remarkable,
by many is lost in the preparation, for our Mercury
is quickened with Sulphur, else it would bee
of no use. A Prince without a people is unhappy;
so is an Alchymist without Sulphur, and Mercury.
If thou hast understood mee, I have said
enough.</p>

<p>very searcher of this Art must in the
first place with a mature judgement
examine the creation, operation, and
vertues of the four Elements together
with their actings: for if hee be ignorant
of the originall, and Nature of these, hee
shall not come to the knowledge of the Principles,
neither shall hee know the true matter of the
Stone, much lesse attain to any good conclusion; because
every end is terminated upon its beginning.
Hee that well knowes what hee begins, shall well
know what shall bee the end. For the originall of
the Elements is the Chaos, out of which God the
Maker of all things created, and separated the Elements,
which belongs to God alone: but out of
the Elements Nature produceth the Principles of
things, and this is Natures worke, through the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
of God alone: Out of the Principles Nature afterwards
produceth Mineralls, and all things: out of
which the Artist also by imitating Nature can doe
many wonderfull things. Because Nature out of these
Principles, which are Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,
doth produce Mineralls, and Metalls, and all kinds
of things; and it doth not simply produce Metalls
out of the Elements, but by Principles, which are
the medium betwixt the Elements, and Metalls:
Therefore if Nature doth not make those things,
much lesse shall Art. And not only in this example,
but also in every naturall processe a middle disposition
is to bee observed. Wherefore here in this Treatise
wee have sufficiently described the Elements,
their actings, and operations, as also the originall
of the Principles (because hitherto no Philosopher
hath discovered things more cleerly) that the well
minded searcher might the more easily consider in
what degree the Stone differs from Metalls, and
Metalls from Elements. For there is a difference
betwixt Gold, and Water, but lesse betwixt Water,
and Mercury; and least of all betwixt Mercury, and
Gold. For the house of Gold is Mercury, and the
house of Mercury is Water: but Sulphur is that
which coagulates Mercury; which <i>S</i>ulphur indeed
is most difficultly prepared, but more difficultly
found out. For in the <i>S</i>ulphur of Philosophers this
secret consists, which also is contained in the inward
rooms of Mercury, of whose preparation, without
which it is unprofitable, wee shall discourse hereafter
in the third <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Princple">Principle</span> of Salt, seeing here wee
treat of the vertue, and originall, not Praxis, of Sulphur.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Wherefore now wee have not writ this Treatise
that wee would disprove any of the ancient Philosophers,
but rather confirm their Writings, and
supply those things, which they have omitted: seeing
that Philosophers themselves were but men, they
could not be accurate in all things, neither is one man
sufficient for all things. Miracles also have seduced
some men from the right way of Nature, as wee read
happened in <i>Albertus Magnus</i> a most witty Philosopher;
who writ, that in his times there were grains of
Gold found betwixt the teeth of a dead man in his
grave. Hee could not find out this Miracle, but judged
it to be by reason of the Minerall vertue in man being
confirmed in his opinion by that saying of <i>Morien</i>:
<i>And this Matter, O King, is extracted from thee</i>: but
this is erroneous, for <i>Morien</i> was pleased to understand
those things Philosophically. For the Minerall vertue
is placed in its own Kingdome, as the Animall is
in its Kingdome, as in the book of the Twelve Treatises
wee have distinguished those Kingdomes, and
divided them into three Kingdomes; because every
one of these without the ingresse of any other thing
stands in it self, and is multiplyed. It is true indeed
that in the Animall Kingdome, Mercury is as the
matter, and Sulphur as the vertue, but the Animall
is not Minerall. The <span class="correction" title="In the original book: vettue">vertue</span> of the Animall Sulphur
if it were not in Man, it could not congeal the bloud
Mercury into flesh, and bones: so also if there were
not a vertue of the Vegetable Sulphur in the Vegetable
Kingdome, it could not coagulate Water, or
the Vegetable Mercury into Herbs, and Trees. So
also it is to bee understood in the Minerall Kingdome.
These three Mercuries doe not indeed differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
in vertue, nor the three <i>S</i>ulphurs, because every
Sulphur hath a power to coagulate its own Mercury;
and every Mercury hath a power to bee coagulated
by its owne proper Sulphur; and by no other
that is a stranger to it. Now the reason why
Gold was found, and generated betwixt the teeth of
the dead man is this, because in his life time Mercury
was by some Physitian conveyed into his infirme
body, either by unction, or by Turbith, or some other
way, as the custome, and manner was, and it was
the nature of Mercury to goe up to the mouth, and
through the sores thereof to be evacuated with the
flegme. If therefore in time of such a cure the sick
man dyed, that Mercury not finding any egresse,
remained in his mouth betwixt his teeth, and that
carkasse became the naturall vessell of Mercury, so
being shut up fast for a long time was congealed into
Gold by its own proper Sulphur, being purified
by the naturall heat of putrefaction, caused by the
corrosive phlegme of the Mans body. But if Minerall
Mercury had not been brought in thither,
there could Gold never have been produced. And
this is a most true example, that Nature in the
bowells of the earth, doth of Mercury alone produce
Gold, and Silver, and other Metalls, according
to the disposition of the place, or matrix; for Mercury
hath in its self its own proper Sulphur, with
which it is coagulated into Gold, unlesse it bee hindred
by some accident, or hath not a requisite heat,
or a close place. The vertue therefore of Animall
Sulphur doth not congeal Mercury into Gold, but
into Flesh: for if there were such a vertue in Man, it
would happen to be so in all bodies; which it doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
not. Many such miracles, and accidents fall out, which
being not well considered by the Writers, occasion
the Readers to fall into errors: yet the honest searcher
must apply all things to the possibility of Nature; if
they doe not agree with Nature, they must be let
alone, and waved.</p>

<p>It sufficeth the diligent Student, that he hath here
heard what is the Originall of the Principles (since
the beginning being unknown, the end is alwaies
doubtfull) of which wee have in this Treatise not
Ænigmatically, but as cleerly as we could, and as it
was lawfull for us, spoken unto the searcher
thereof: by means of which, if God shall enlighten
any ones mind, hee shall know what a successor owes
to his predecessors, seeing this Art is alwaies acquired
by the same kind of wits, and dispositions. Which Art
wee after this kind of clear manifestation of it, lay up
into the bosome of God the most high Creator, and
our Lord, and commend our selvs together with all
honest hearted Readers to his grace, and infinite mercy.
To whom be praise, and glory, for ever, and
ever.</p>

<i>THE FIRST BOOKE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the generations of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The generation of naturall things is twofold.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap3" src="images/c_001_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" /></div>

<p>
he generation of all natural things
is twofold: Naturall, and without
Art; and Artificiall, <i>viz.</i> by
Alchymie. Although in generall
it may bee said that all things are
naturally generated of the Earth
by means of putrefaction. For
<span class="sidenote">All things proceed from putrefaction.</span>
Putrefaction is the chiefe degree,
and first step to Generation. Now Putrefaction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2a" id="Page_2a"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
occasioned by a moist heat.
<span class="sidenote">The cause of putrefaction is a moist heat.</span>For a continuall moist
heat causeth putrefaction, and changeth all naturall
things from their first form, and essence, as also their
vertues, and efficacy, into another thing.
<span class="sidenote">The power and nature of putrefaction.</span>For as putrefaction
in the stomach changeth, and reduceth all
meats into dung; so also putrefaction out of the
stomach in a glasse, changeth all things from one
form into another, from one essence into another,
from one colour into another, from one smell into
another, from one vertue into another, from one
power into another, from one property into another,
and generally from one quality into another.
For it is evident, and proved by daily experience,
that many good things, which are wholsome, and medicinable,
become after putrefaction naught, unwholsome,
and meer poison. So on the contrary,
there are many bad, unwholsome, poisonous, and
hurtfull things, which after their putrefaction become
good, lose all their unwholsomnesse, and become
wonderfull medicinable: because putrefaction
produceth great matters, as of this wee have a most
famous example in the holy Gospel, where Christ
saith: Unlesse a grain of Wheat bee cast into the
Earth, and be putrefied, it cannot bring forth fruit
in a hundred fold. Hence also we must know, that
many things are multiplyed in putrefaction so as to
bring forth excellent fruit.
<span class="sidenote">What putrefaction is.</span>For putrefaction is the
change, and death of all things, and destruction of
the first essence of all Naturall things; whence there
ariseth a regeneration, and new generation a thousand
times better, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Putrefaction is the first degree to generation.</div>

<p>Seeing therefore putrefaction is the first degree,
and step to generation; it is very necessary that wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3a" id="Page_3a"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
know putrefaction well. Now there are many kinds
of putrefactions, and one produceth its generation
in another manner, then doth another. One also sooner
then another. <span class="sidenote">Putrefaction is manifold.</span>Wee said also that moisture, and
heat were the first degree, and step to putrefaction,
which produceth all things, as a Hen doth her egs.
Wherefore through, and in putrefaction, all mucilaginous
flegme, and matter is made living, whatsoever
it prove to be at last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An artificiall hatching of Chickens.</div>

<p>An example of this you have in egs, in which there
is a mucilaginous humour, which by any kind of moderate
continuall heat is putrefied, and turned into a
living Chicke, not only by the heat of the Hen, but
any such kind of heat. For in such a degree of Fire
egs may be brought to maturity in a glasse, and
ashes, and become living birds: yea any man may
ripen an egge in his arm-hole, and hatch a Chicke, as
well as the Hen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The raising of a dead bird to life.</div>

<p>And here wee must take notice of something that
is greater, and more then this: <i>viz.</i> if that living
Chicke be in a vessell of glasse like a gourd, and sealed
up, burnt to powder, or ashes in the third degree
of Fire, and afterward so closed in, be putrefied with
the exactest putrefaction of Horse-dung, into a mucilaginous
flegm, then that flegm may be brought to
maturity, and become a renewed, and new made
Chicke: to wit, if that flegm bee againe inclosed in
its former shell, or receptacle. This is to revive the
dead by regeneration, and clarification, which indeed
is a great, and profound miracle of Nature. According
to this processe may all Birds bee killed, and
made alive againe, and made new: and this is the
highest, and greatest miracle, and mystery of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
which hee ever discovered to mortall man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Artificiall generation of Man.</div>

<p>Wee must also know that after this manner men
may bee generated without naturall Father, or Mother,
<i>i.e.</i> not of a Woman in a naturall way: but by
the Art, and industry of a skilfull Alchymist may a
Man bee borne, and grow, as afterwards shall bee
shewed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The generation of men by brutes.</div>

<p>It is possible also that men may be born of beasts,
according to naturall causes, but yet this cannot bee
done without much impiety, and heresie; to wit, if a
man should couple with a beast, and that beast should,
as a woman doth, receive the Sperm of the man, with
desire and lust into her matrix, and conceive: then
the sperm doth of necessity putrefie, and by the continual
heat of the body, a man, and not a beast is thence
produced. <span class="sidenote">As the seed is, so is the fruit.</span>For alwaies as the seed is that is sown,
so also is the fruit that is brought forth; and unlesse it
should be so, it would be contrary to the light of Nature,
and to Philosophy. Wherefore as is the seed,
such is the hearb that springs from thence. So of the
Seed of an Onyon is brought forth an Onyon, not a
Rose, nor a Nut, not a Lettuce. So of Corne, Corn
is brought forth, of Barley, Barley; of Oats, Oats:
and so it is with all other fruits, which have seed, and
are sown, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The force of womens imagination.</div>

<p>In like manner also it is possible, and not contrary
to Nature, that an irrationall bruit should bee
produced by a woman, and a man. Neither are wee
to judge of, or censure the woman, as the man, (as in
the former case) shee therefore is not to bee accounted
impious, or hereticall, as if shee acted contrary
to Nature, but it is to be imputed to her imagination.
For her imagination is alwaies the cause of it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
the imagination of a breeding woman is so powerful,
that in conceiving the seed into her body, shee may
change her infant divers wayes: because her inward
starres are so strongly bent upon the infant, that they
beget an impression, and influence upon it. Wherefore
the infant in the Mothers wombe in its forming is put
into the hand, and will of its Mother, as clay in the
hand of the Potter, who thence frames, and makes
what his will, and pleasure is: so the Woman that is
breeding, forms the fruit in her body, according to
her imagination, and her starres. Therefore it often
falls out, that of the seed of a man, Cattle, and other
horrid Monsters are begot, according as the imagination
of the Mother is strongly directed upon the
Embryo, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now as you have heard, that by putrefaction many,
and various things are generated, and made alive,
so also you must know, that of many hearbs, by putrefaction
divers living creatures are bred, which they
that are skilled in these things know.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All animals that are bred meerly
of putrefaction are poisonous.</div>

<p>Here also wee must know, that all such Animalls,
which are bred, and made of putrefaction, containe
some poison, and are poisonous, yet one far more
strong then another, and one after another manner
then another: as you see in Serpents, Vipers, Toads,
Frogs, Scorpions, Basiliskes, Spiders, Wood-bees,
Pismires, and many sorts of Wormes, as Cankers,
Maggots, Locusts, &amp;c. All which are bred in, and
through putrefaction. Also amongst Animalls there
are bred divers Monsters; And there are Monsters
also which are not bred of putrefaction of themselves,
but are made by Art in a glasse, as hath been said;
because they oftentimes appear in a very wonderfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
shape, and form, fearful to behold, as oftentimes with
many feet, many tailes, many colours, oftentimes
many heads, worms with the tailes of Fishes, or feathers,
and other unusuall forms, that the like have not
been seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Monsters are.</div>

<p>Wherefore not only all Animalls, which have not
proper Parents, and are not borne of things like to
themselves are Monsters, but also those which are
bred of other things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The secret poison of the Basilisk.</div>

<p>So you see it is concerning a Basiliske, which also
is a Monster, and indeed a Monster above all Monsters,
and then which none is to bee more dreaded,
because hee can kill any man with his meer looks, and
sight: and because his poison is above all poisons, to
which nothing in the world is to bee compared. Hee
carries his poison in a most secret manner in his eyes,
and it is a conceived poison, not much unlike a menstruous
woman, who also carrieth a secret poison in
her eyes, so that only by her looks a Looking-glasse
is fouled, and tainted. So also if shee looke upon a
wound, or an ulcer, shee infects that in the like manner,
and hinders the cure thereof: so also with her
breath, as well as sight, shee infects divers things, corrupts,
and weakens them; and so also with her touch.
For you see if shee medle with wine in time of her
menstrues, that it is suddainly changed and made
thick; The Vineger also that she medles withall, becomes
dead, and uselesse: so also Hot-waters lose
their strength: In like manner Civet, Amber Gryse,
Musk, and such like perfumes, lose their odour by
such a womans carrying, or handling of them.
So also Gold, and Coralls lose their colour,
also many Gemmes, and Looking-glasses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
soiled therewith, &amp;c. But to return to what I proposed
concerning the Basiliske, by what reason, and in what
manner hee carries poison in his looks, and eyes; you
must know that hee hath that property, and poison
from menstruous women, as is aforesaid. For the Basiliske
is bred of, and proceeds from the greatest impurity
of a Woman, <i>viz.</i> her Menstrues, and from
the blood of the Sperm, if it bee put into a gourd
glasse, and putrefied in Horse-dung, in which putrefaction
a Basiliske is brought forth. But who is so
couragious, and bold to make, take him out, and
kill him again, unlesse hee cover, and fortifie himselfe
well first with glasses: I should perswade none to
doe it, nay, I would advise them to take heed of
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monsters doe not live long.</div>

<p>But that I may proceed in treating of Monsters,
Know that Monsters amongst brutes, which are
brought forth of other things, and not of their like,
seldome live long, especially if they shall live neer,
or amongst other brutes, because of an imbred
disposition, and Gods disposing, all Monsters are
odious unto brutes that are genuinely brought
forth, and so also Monsters of men, which are
generated by man, seldome live long. And by
how much the more wonderfull, and remarkable they
are, so much the sooner they dye, so that none exceed
the third day amongst men, unlesse they bee presently
carryed into some secret place, and kept apart from
all men. Moreover you must know that God abhors
these kind of Monsters, and that they are displeasing
to him, and that none of them can be saved, seeing
they bear not the image of God:<span class="sidenote">Monsters come
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: fom">from</span> the Devill.</span>whence wee can
conjecture nothing else, but that they are so formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
by the Devil, and are made for the Devills service, rather
then Gods, because no good work was ever done
by any Monster, but rather all manner of evill, wickednesse,
and devillish deceits. For as an Executioner
marketh his sons in cutting off their ears, putting
out their eyes, burning their cheeks, fingers, hands,
and cutting off their heads: so doth the Devil mark
his sons through the imagination of their Mothers,
which in their conceiving they drew from evill desires,
lusts, and cogitations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monsters are to be shunned.</div>

<p>Also all men are to be shunned, which abound with,
or want any member, or have a double member. For
that is a presage of the Devills, and a most certaine
signe of some occult wickednesse, and deceit, which
follows upon it. Wherefore they seldome dye without
the Executioner, or at least from some marke
made by him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The artificiall generation of Men.</div>

<p>But wee must by no means forget the generation
of Artificiall men. For there is some truth in this
thing, although it hath been a long time concealed,
and there have been no small Doubts, and Questions,
raised by some of the ancient Philosophers, Whether
it were possible for Nature, or Art to beget a Man
out of the body of a Woman, and naturall matrix?
To this I answer, that it is no way repugnant to the
Art of Alchymie, and Nature; yea it is very possible:
But to effect it, we must proceed thus.</p>

<p>Let the Sperm of a man by it selfe be putrefied in a
gourd glasse, sealed up, with the highest degree of
putrefaction in Horse dung, for the space of forty
days, or so long untill it begin to bee alive, move, and
stir, which may easily be seen. After this time it will
bee something like a Man, yet transparent, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a"></a>[Pg 9]</span>out
a body. Now after this, if it bee every day warily,
and prudently nourished and fed with the <i>Arcanum</i>
of Mans blood, and bee for the space of forty
weeks kept in a constant, equall heat of Horse-dung, it
will become a true, and living infant, having all the
members of an infant, which is born of a woman, but
it will bee far lesse. This wee call <i>Homunculus</i>, or
Artificiall. And this is afterwards to be brought up
with as great care, and diligence as any other infant,
untill it come to riper years of understanding. Now
this is one of the greatest secrets, that God ever made
known to mortall, sinfull man. For this is a miracle,
and one of the great wonders of God, and secret
above all secrets, and deservedly it ought to bee
kept amongst the secrets until the last times, when nothing
shall be hid, but all things be made manifest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fairies, Nymphs, Gyants, &amp;c. are
made of artificiall men.</div>

<p>And although hitherto it hath not been known to
men, yet it hath been known to Fairies of the Woods,
Nymphs, and Gyants many ages since, because they
come from them. For of such Artificiall men,
when they come to Mans age, are made Pygmies,
Gyants, and other great and monstrous men, who are
instruments of great matters, who obtaine great
victories against their Enemies, and know all secrets,
and mysteries: because by Art they receive their
lives, by Art they receive their bodies, flesh, bones,
and blood: by Art they are borne; wherefore Art is
now incorporated with, and imbred in them, and
they need not learn of any, but others are constrained
to learn of them, for by Art they have their originall
and present existency, as a rose, or flower in a garden,
and they are called the children of Fairies, and
Nymphs, by reason that in power, and vertue they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
are like not to Men, but Spirits, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of 3 principles Mercury the Spirit, sulphur
is the soul, Salt the body.</div>

<p>Here it is necessary that wee speak something of
the generation of Metalls; but because we have wrote
sufficiently of that in our book of the generation of
Metals, wee shall very briefly treat of it here, only
briefly adding what was omitted in that book. Know
that all the seven Metalls are brought forth after this
manner, out of a threefold matter, <i>viz.</i> Mercury, Sulphur,
&amp; Salt, yet in distinct, and peculiar colours. For
this reason <i>Hermes</i> did not speak amisse, when he said,
that of three substances are all the seven Metalls produced,
and compounded, as also the Tinctures, and
Philosophers Stone. Those 3 substances he calls the
Spirit, Soul, and Body: but hee did not shew how
this is to bee understood, or what hee did mean by
this, although haply hee might know the three Principles,
but did not make mention of them. Wherefore
we do not say, that he was here in an error, but only
was silent now, that those 3 distinct substances may
be rightly understood, <i>viz.</i> Spirit, Soul, and Body, we
must know, that they signifie nothing else but the
three Principles, <i>i.e.</i> Mercury, Sulphur, Salt, of which
all the seven Metalls are generated. For Mercury is
the Spirit, Sulphur the Soule, and Salt the Body, but
a Metall is the Soul betwixt the Spirit, and the Body
(as <i>Hermes</i> saith) which Soule indeed is Sulphur; and
unites these two contraries, the Body, and Spirit,
and changeth them into one essence, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether metalls can be made artificially by fire.</div>

<p>Now this is not to bee understood so as that of
every Mercury, every Sulphur, or of every Salt, the
seven Metalls may be generated, or the Tincture, or
the Philosophers Stone by the Art of Alchymie,
or industry, with the help of Fire; but all the seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
Metalls must be generated in the mountains by the
Archeius of the Earth. For the Alchymist shall
sooner transmute Metalls, then generate, or make
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Living <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> is the mother of metalls.</div>

<p>
Yet neverthelesse living Mercury is the Mother
of all the seven Metalls, and deservedly it
may be called the Mother of the Metalls. For it is an
open Metall, and as it contains all colours, which
it manifests in the Fire, so also occultly it contains
all Metalls in it selfe, but without Fire it cannot
shew them, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The regeneration of metalls into tinctures.</div>

<p>But generation, and renovation of Metalls is
made thus: As a man may return into the womb of
his Mother, <i>i.e.</i> into the Earth, out of which hee
was first made a man, and shall again bee raised at
the last day: so also all Metalls may returne into living
<span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> againe, and become <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span>, and by Fire bee regenerated,
and purified, if for the space of forty weeks,
they bee kept in a continuall heat, as an infant is in
his Mothers wombe. So that now there are brought
forth not common Metalls, but Tinging Metalls. For
if Silver bee regenerated (after the manner as wee
have spoken) it will afterward tinge all other Metalls
into Silver, so will Gold into Gold, and the
like is to bee understood of all the other Metalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Soul is that medium wherewith the
soule is united to the body.</div>

<p>Now forasmuch as <i>Hermes</i> said, that the soule
alone is that medium which joines the spirit to
the body, it was not without cause hee said so.
For seeing Sulphur is that soule, and doth like Fire
ripen, and digest all things; it can also bind the
soule with the body, incorporating, and uniting
them together, so that from thence may bee produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
a most excellent body. Now the common
combustible Sulphur is not to bee taken for the
soule of metalls, for the soule is another manner
of thing then a combustible, and corruptible
body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the soule of metalls is.</div>

<p>Wherefore it can bee destroyed by no Fire, seeing
indeed it is all Fire it selfe: and indeed it is nothing
else but the quintessence of Sulphur, which
is extracted out of reverberated Sulphur by the spirit
of wine, being of a red colour, and as transparent as a Rubie:
and which indeed is a great, and
excellent <i>Arcanum</i>, for the transmuting of white
metalls, and to coagulate living <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> into fixt, and
true Gold. Esteeme this as an enriching treasure,
and thou maist bee well contented with
this, onely secret in the Transmutation of Metalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where is the generation of metalls and mineralls.</div>

<p>Concerning the generation of mineralls, and halfe
metalls nothing else need bee known then what was
at first said concerning metalls, <i>viz.</i> that they are in
like manner produced of the three Principles, <i>viz.</i>
Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, although not as metalls
of perfect, but of the more imperfect, and baser Mercury,
Sulphur, and Salt, and yet with their distinct
colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whence the generation of Gemmes.</div>

<p>The generation of Gemmes is from the subtilty
of the Earth, of transparent and crystalline Mercury,
Sulphur, and Salt, even according to their distinct
colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Also of Common Stones.</div>

<p>But the generation of common Stones is of the
subtilty of Water, of mucilaginous Mercury, Sulphur,
and Salt. For of the mucilaginousnesse of Water
are produced all stones, as also sand, and gra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a"></a>[Pg 13]</span>vell
are thence coagulated into Stones, as wee often
see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An artificiall generation of Stones.</div>

<p>For any stone put in the Water, doth suddenly contract
a mucilaginousnesse to itself. Now if that mucilaginous
matter bee taken from this Stone, and
coagulated in a glasse, it becomes such a Stone, as
was in that Water, but it would require a long
time before it would be coagulated of it selfe.</p>

<i>THE SECOND BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the growth, and increase of
Naturall things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat and Moisture the cause of the growth of things.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_014_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>t is sufficiently manifest, and knowne to
every one, that all naturall things grow,
and are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: ripned">ripened</span> through heat, and moisture,
which is sufficiently demonstrated by rain,
and the heat of the sun. For no man can deny that
rain doth make the Earth fruitfull, and it is granted
by all, that all fruits are ripened by the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15a" id="Page_15a"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An artificiall ripening of things.</div>

<p>Seeing therefore this is by divine ordination naturally
possible, who can gain-say, or not beleeve that
a man is able, through the wise, and skilfull Art of
Alchymie, to make that which is barren, fruitfull, and
that which is crude, to ripen, and all things to grow,
and to be increased. <span class="sidenote">God hath subjected all
things to man.</span>For the Scripture saith, that God
subjected all creatures to man, and put them into his
hands as being his own, that hee might use them for
his necessity, and rule over the fish of the sea, fowles
of the aire, and all things upon the Earth, nothing excepted.
Wherefore man might well rejoice that God
should so endow him with the excellency of Nature,
that all the creatures of God should be forced to obey,
and be subject to him, especially the whole Earth, and
all things which are bred, live, and move in, and upon
it. Since therefore wee see with our eyes, and are
taught by daily experience, that by how much the
oftner, &amp; more abundantly the rain doth moisten the
earth, and the sun doth again with its heat and warmth
dry it, so much the sooner doe the fruits of the Earth
come forth and are ripened, yea all fruits doe cleerly
grow, and increase, what time of the yeer soever it be;
<span class="sidenote">The artificiall generation of fruit.</span>Let no man henceforth wonder, that the Alchymist
also by a manifold imbibition, and distillation should
not doe the same. For what else is rain but the imbibition
of the Earth? and the heat of the Sun, but the
distillation of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: un">Sun</span>, which drawes up those humidities
again? Wherefore I say it is possible by such a
kind of Art, even in the midle of Winter to bring
forth green Herbs, Flowers, and other fruit, through
Earth, and Water, out of the seed, and root: If then
this can bee done in all Herbs, and flowers, it may
also bee done in many other like things, as in all mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16a" id="Page_16a"></a>[Pg 16]</span>neralls,
whose imperfect metalls by vertue of a minerall
water may bee brought to maturity through the
industry, and Art of a skilfull Alchymist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ripening of mineralls.</div>

<p>In like manner may all <i>Marcasites</i>, <i>Granati</i>, <i>Zineta</i>,
<i>Arsenica</i>, <i>Talka</i>, <i>Cachymie</i>, <i>Bisemuta</i>, <i>Antimonies</i>, &amp;c.
(all which carry with them crude Gold, and Silver,)
bee so ripened, that they may bee equalized to the
most rich veins of Gold, and Silver, only by this Art.
So also the Elixir, and tinctures of metals are brought
to maturity, and perfected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the growing of the beard of a dead man signifies.</div>

<p>Seeing therefore, as it hath been said, moisture, and
heat doe ripen all things, and make them grow, Let
none wonder, that the beard, haire, or nailes of a malefactor
hanging on a Gibbet, or Wheel do for a long
time grow, neither let it be accounted for a sign of his
innocency, as the ignorant beleeve, for this is naturall,
and from naturall causes. For whilest that any moisture
remains in him, his beard, haire, and nailes grow,
even till the second year, or till hee bee wholly putrefied,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The augmentation of <span class="not-mobile">☉</span><span class="mobile-only">[Sun]</span>.</div>

<p>
Wee must also know, that there are many things
that grow for ever, and are increased in bignesse,
weight, and vertue, in the Water, and Earth, in which
they continue good, and efficacious, as are Metalls,
Marcasites, Cachymie, Talka, Granuty, Antimony,
Bisemuta, Gemmes, Pearles, Corals, all Stones, and
Clay. So also it may be ordered, that Gold may
grow, and bee increased in weight, and body, if only
it bee buryed in the Earth looking towards the <i>East</i>,
and bee alwaies soiled with the fresh urine of a man,
and pigeons dung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Gold may be generated in a glasse.</div>

<p>It is possible also that Gold, through industry, and
skill of an expert Alchymist may bee so far exalted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17a" id="Page_17a"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
that it may grow in a glasse like a tree, with many
wonderfull boughs, and leaves, which indeed is pleasant
to behold, and most wonderful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Philosophicall Tree is made.</div>

<p>The processe is this. Let Gold bee calcined with
<i>Aqua Regis</i>, till it becomes a kind of chalke, which
put into a gourd glasse, and poure upon it good new
<i>Aqua Regis</i>, so that it may cover it foure fingers
breadth, then again draw it off, with the third degree
of fire, untill no more ascend. The water that
is distilled off, poure on againe, then distill it off againe.
This doe so long untill thou seest the Gold to
rise in the glasse, and grow after the manner of a tree,
having many boughes, and leaves: and so there is
made of Gold a wonderful, and pleasant shrub, which
the Alchymists call their Golden hearb, and the Philosophers
Tree. In like manner you may proceed with
Silver, and other Metalls, yet so that their calcination
bee made after another manner, by another <i>Aqua
fortis</i>, which I leave to thine experience. If thou
art skilled in Alchymie, thou shalt not erre in these
things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To make an artificiall stone of any forme.</div>

<p>Know also that any flint taken out of River water,
(and put into a gourd glasse, having River water
poured upon it, that the glasse may bee filled,
which Water is againe to bee distilled off as long
as a drop will arise, and the Stone dryed, and
the Glasse againe filled with this Water, and againe
distilled off, and this done so long till the
Glasse bee filled with this Stone) may in a few
dayes by the Art of Alchymie bee made very
great, which the Archeius of the Waters could
scarce doe in many yeers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18a" id="Page_18a"></a>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>If then thou breake the Glasse, thou shalt have
a Flint in the forme of the Glasse, as if it had
been put into the Glasse, and although this bee
not for profit, yet it is a thing that is strange, and
wonderfull.</p>

<i>THE THIRD BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the preservations of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The enemies of things are to be knowne.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_019_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" /></div>

<p>hat things may bee preserved, and kept
from harm, it is necessary in the first place
to know what is an enemie to them, that so
they may be preserved from that, &amp; not be
hurt, or corrupted by it either in substance, vertue,
power, or any way whatsoever. Much therefore in
this case depends upon the knowing of the Enemie
of all Naturall things. For who can take heed of
danger when hee doth not know what can hurt him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20a" id="Page_20a"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
Truly no body; Wherefore it is necessary to know
ones Enemie, For there are many sorts of Enemies.
Wherefore it is as necessary to know evill things, as
good things: for who can know what is good, without
the knowing of what is evill? Truly no body. So no
man can know what a blessing health is, that was never
sick. Who knows what joy is, that was never heavy,
or sad? And who can rightly understand what God
is, who knew nothing of the Devil?
<span class="sidenote">Death is the enemie of things.</span>Wherefore when
God made known to us the Enemie of our Soul, <i>viz.</i>
the Devill, he also signified to us the Enemie of our
life, <i>viz.</i> Death, which is the Enemie of our body,
of our health, and the Enemie of Medicinall, and all
naturall things: also he made known to us how, and
by which means it may be shunned.
<span class="sidenote">There is a Contrariety found in all things.</span>For as there
is no disease against which there is not created, and
found some remedy, which should cure, and expell it:
so also there is alwaies one thing ordained against
another, one Water against another, one Stone against
another, one Minerall against another, one Poison against
another, one Metall against another: and so in
many more things, all which it is not requisite here to
recite.</p>

<p>Now how, and by what means every thing is to
bee preserved, and kept from hurt, wee must know,
that many things are to bee preserved in the Earth,
and especially all rootes doe for a long time remaine
in the Earth without losing their vertue, or being corrupted:
in like manner herbs, flowers, and all fruites
continue in the water incorrupted, and green: there
are also many fruits, and apples that may be preserved
in water from all manner of putrefaction, untill new
fruit come againe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21a" id="Page_21a"></a>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How to preserve flesh and blood.</div>

<p>So also flesh, and blood, which indeed are putrefied,
and grow unsavoury quickly, are preserved in cold
fountain-water, and not only so, but by the addition of
new <span class="correction" title="In the original book: aud">and</span> fresh fountaine-water, may be turned into
a quintessence, and bee forever preserved from putrefaction,
and an ill savour, without any balsome.
And this doth not only preserve the flesh, and blood
of dead things, but also of the living, wherefore Mans
body may bee preserved from all manner of putrefaction,
and divers diseases that proceed from putrefaction,
better then common Mummie. Now that
blood may be preserved of it self from putrefaction,
and stinking, and not as a quintessence, &amp; so as it may
preserve the blood of the living (as we now said) thou
must follow this processe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Arcanum of mans blood is to be prepared.</div>

<p>Let the blood bee separated from its flegm, which
is separated of its selfe, and is driven to the upper
part. This water poure gently out of the vessell, and
in stead of it put as much of the water of the salt of
blood, which water wee teach to make in our Chirurgerie:
That water doth presently mixe with the
blood, and preserves it so, that it will never bee putrefied,
or grow unsavory, but continue many years
as fresh, and very red as it was the first day: and this
indeed is a great wonder. But if thou dost not know
how to make this water, or hast it not in readiness, then
poure upon it so much of the best, and most excellent
balsome, and this will doe the same. Now, this
blood is the balsome of balsomes, and is called the
<i>Arcanum</i> of blood, and it is so wonderful, and of such
great vertue, that it is incredible to be spoken; wherefore
thou shalt conceale it as a great secret in Physick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22a" id="Page_22a"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How metalls may be preserved.</div>

<p>In preserving of Metalls, their Enemies are first to
bee known, that so much the better they may bee
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: preserrved">preserved</span> from harme. <span class="sidenote">What are the
enemies of metalls.</span>The chiefest Enemies of
Metalls are all sharp corroding Waters, all Corrosive
things, all Salts, crude Sulphur, Antimony, and
Mercury. But that you may know particularly
how they show their enmity, it is thus. Sharp Waters,
and such things as are Corrosive, and Salts
shew their enmity, in that they mortifie, dissolve, calcine,
corrupt Metalls, and reduce them to nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the fume of Sulphur doth discolour metalls.</div>

<p>Crude Sulphur shews its enmity in the fume thereof:
for by its fume it takes away from Copper its colour,
and rednesse, and makes it white. From white
Metalls, as Silver, Tinne, Lead, and Iron it takes
away the whitenesse, and makes them red, and yellowish.
From Gold it takes away that faire amiable
yellownesse, and golden colour, and makes
it black, and so foule, that nothing can bee more
foule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Antimony spoiles and discolours metalls.</div>

<p>Antimony shews its enmity in this, in that all Metalls
with which it is melted, or mixed, it spoiles,
carryeth away, and preys upon, and also not unlike to
Sulphur, by its fume it takes away from Metalls
their true, and naturall colour, and brings in another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quicksilver distroyes metalls, and how.</div>

<p>Quicksilver doth destroy Metalls upon this accompt, in
that it enters into Metalls, with which it is
joined, and dissolves them, so that it makes an
Amalgama of them: Wherefore the fume thereof,
which wee call common Mercury, makes all Metalls
brittle, that they cannot bee malleated, and calcines
them, also it makes all red Metalls of a golden co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23a" id="Page_23a"></a>[Pg 23]</span>lour,
to bee white: but it is the greatest enemie of all
to Iron, and Steel; for if common Mercury doe but
touch a barre of Iron, or Steel, or that be but smeared
over with Mercuriall oile, that bar will afterward be
broken like glasse, and be bowed; which indeed is a
great secret, and deserves to be kept exceeding close.
In like manner must the Loadstone be kept from
Mercury, for the like enmity it shews to that as to
Iron. <span class="sidenote">How the loadstone may be spoyled.</span>For any Loadstone that Mercury hath but
touched, or which hath been smeered with Mercuriall
oyle, or only put into Mercury, will never draw
Iron more. Let no man wonder at this, for there
is a naturall cause for it, and it is this, <i>viz.</i> because
Mercury extracts the spirit of Iron, which was hid in
the Loadstone, which spirit draws the spirit of Iron
to it: and this is not only in the Loadstone, but in
all naturall things else, so that alwaies a strange spirit
in a body which is not of the same Nature with
it selfe, drawes to it self a body which is of the
same Nature: and this wee must know to bee so,
not only in the Loadstone, but also in all other
naturall things, as Mineralls, Stones, Hearbs, Roots,
Men, and Brutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What antipathy there is betwixt metalls themselves.</div>

<p>That Metalls have an enmity, and hate one the
other naturally, as you see in Lead, which is naturally
a very great enemy to Gold. For it breaks asunder
all parts of Gold, it makes it foule, weak, spoiles,
and destroyes it even to death, more then any other
Metall.</p>

<p>Tin also hates, and is an enemy to all Metalls: for
it makes them base, immalleable, hard, unprofitable,
if it bee mixed with them in the fire, or in melting.</p>

<p>Since therefore you have now heard of the Enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24a" id="Page_24a"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
of Metalls, you must next know their preservatives,
which keep them from all manner of hurt, or corruption,
also strengthen them in their Nature, and
vertue, and exalt their colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold is preserved in boyes urine.</div>

<p>First therefore concerning Gold, you must know,
that it cannot bee preserved better, and fairer then
in boyes urine, in which Salt Armoniack is dissolved,
or in water alone of Salt Armoniack. In them in
time the colour is so highly exalted that it can bee
exalted no higher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How silver is preserved.</div>

<p>Silver cannot be better preserved then if it be boiled
in common Water, or Vineger, in which Tartar
or Salt have been dissolved. So any old Silver, that
is made black, and fouled, is renewed by being boiled
in these waters. <span class="sidenote">How Iron and Steel
may be preserved.</span>The best preservative for Iron
and Steel is the lard of a Barrow-hog not salted,
which indeed preserves Iron, and Steel from rust,
if once every moneth they be smeered over with it.
Also if Iron bee melted with fixt Arsenicke, it will be
so renewed and fixt, that it will like Silver never contract
rust. <span class="sidenote">How Copper is preserved.</span>Copper may be preserved, if it bee only
mixed with sublimed Mercury, or bee smeered over
with the oyle of Salt; and so it will never any more be
grown over with verdegrease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Lead is preserved.</div>

<p>Lead can no wayes bee better preserved then in
cold Earth, and in a moist place, according to the
Nature thereof. <span class="sidenote">How the Loadstone is
preserved.</span>The Loadstone is preserved best
of all with the filings of Iron, and Steel, for by
this meanes it is never weakened, but daily strengthened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preservation of Salts.</div>

<p>Now concerning the preservation of Salts, and all
things, that are of a saltish Nature, and may be comprehended
under the name of Salt (of which there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25a" id="Page_25a"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
more then an hundred sorts) you must know that
they are to bee preserved in a hot dry place, and in
woodden vessells, not in Glasse, Stone, or Metalls:
for in those they are dissolved and become a Water,
and an Amalgama which cannot be in Wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preservation of liquors with oils.</div>

<p>Moreover you must know how some kind of
Waters, and Liquors pressed out of hearbs, roots, and
all other fruits, and Vegetables, which doe easily
contract filth, and slime as if a skin were spread over
them, may be preserved. These Waters therefore, and
Liquors must bee put up into glasses that are narrow
towards the top, and wide below, and the glasses be
filled to the top, then adde a few drops of oyl Olive,
that all the Water, or Liquor may bee covered: so
the Oyl will swim on the top, and preserve the Liquor,
or Water a long time from filth or slime. For
there is no Water, or liquor if it bee covered with
oyl, that will bee musty, or of an ill savour.</p>

<p>By this means also may two sorts of Water, of
Liquors of Wine bee kept apart in one vessell, that
they may not bee mixed: and not only two sorts, but
three, four, five, and more, if only the oyle bee put
betwixt: For they are severed by the Oyle, as by a
wall, which wil not suffer them to be joined together,
and united, for oyle and water are two contraries, and
neither can be mixed with the other: For as the Oyle
will not suffer the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Watres">Waters</span> to be united, so on the contrary, the
Water will not suffer the Oyls to be mixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How clothes are preserved.</div>

<p>Now to preserve Cloath, and Garments from
moths, there is no better way then with Mastick,
Camphire, Amber Gryse, and Muske,
and Civet, which indeed is the best of all,
which doth not only preserve them from moths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26a" id="Page_26a"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
but also, drives away moths, and all other vermine, as
Fleas, Lice, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How all sorts of Wood may be preserved.</div>

<p>Also all manner of Woods, as in Houses, Bridges,
Ships, or wheresoever they be, may bee preserved so
that they will never bee putrefied, either in waters, or
under waters, or out of water in the earth, under the
earth or above the earth, whether they be set in the
rain, or wind, aire, snow, or ice, in winter, or summer;
also that they be not worm-eaten, nor that any worms
may breed in them whensoever they bee cut. Now
this preservative is a great <i>Arcanum</i> against all kinds
of putrefactions, yea so excellent a secret that none
may bee compared to it. <span class="sidenote">Fixed oyle of
sulphur.</span>And it is nothing else but
Oyle of Sulphur, the processe whereof is this. Let
common yellow Sulphur bee powdered, and put
into a Gourd glasse, upon which let there be poured
so much of the strongest <i>Aqua fortis</i>, that may cover
it three fingers breadth: then draw it oft by distillation,
three, or four times; and last of all, till it be dry.
Let the Sulphur that remaines in the bottome being
of a black, sad red colour, be put upon marble, or
in a glasse, and it will easily bee dissolved into Oyle,
which is a great secret in preserving of Wood from
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: putrefacton">putrefaction</span>, and wormes. For this Oyle doth so
tinge the wood that is nointed with it, that it can
never bee washed out of it againe. Many more
things may bee preserved with this Oil of Sulphur;
from putrefaction, as ropes, cords in ships, and masts
of ships, in carts, fishing-nets, and gins which
Fowlers, and Hunters use, and such like, which are oftentimes
used in waters, or raine, and are otherwise
easily rotted, and broken, so also linnen clothes, and
many other such like things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27a" id="Page_27a"></a>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Which are potable things, and how they
are preserved.</div>

<p>Also you must know how potable things are to be
preserved, by which wee understand Wine, Beer,
Meade, Vineger, and Milke. <span class="sidenote">Which is an enemie
to them.</span>Now if we would
preserve these from harm, and in their full vertue, it
is very necessary that you know well what is an Enemie
to them, and that is menstruous women: for
if they doe handle the foresaid things, or have
any thing to doe about them, or looke, or breath
upon them, they corrupt them. For Wine is thereby
changed, and become thick, Beer, and Mead grow
sowre, Vineger grows dead, and loseth its sharpnesse;
and Milke grows sowre, and curded.</p>

<p>This therefore you must well know, before
you come to preserve each of these in particular.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Wine is preserved by Sulphur.</div>

<p>Wine is preserved chiefly by Sulphur, and the
Oyle of Sulphur, by which all Wine may bee preserved
a long time, so that it be neither thick, nor any
other way changed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beere is preserved with oyle of Cloves.</div>

<p>Beere is preserved with Oyle of Cloves, if some
drops thereof bee put into it, to every Gallon two
or three drops, or, which is better, with the Oyl of
the root of <i>Avens</i>, which doth preserve Beer from
sowring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mead is preserved with oyle of Sugar.</div>

<p>Meade is preserved with Oyl of Sugar, which must
bee used as the Oyle of Cloves abovesaid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Vineger is preserved.</div>

<p>Vineger is preserved with Oyle of Ginger, which
must be used as the Oyle of Cloves abovesaid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Milke is preserved.</div>

<p>Milke is preserved with Oyle of Almonds made
by expression, which must bee used as the Oyle of
Cloves abovesaid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cheese is preserved with St. Johns wort.</div>

<p>Cheese is preserved with St. <i>Iohns</i> wort from
worms, for if it doth but touch it, no worme will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28a" id="Page_28a"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
breed in it: and if there bee any in before, it will
kill them, and make them fall out of the Cheese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Honey is to be preserved.</div>

<p>Honey hath no peculiar preservative, onely that it
may bee kept from its Enemie. <span class="sidenote">What its chief
enemie is.</span>Now its chief Enemie
is bread: for if a little bread made of Corne bee
but put, or <span class="correction" title="In the original book: falnin">faln</span> into it, all the Honey is turned
into Emmots, and spoiled.</p>

<i>THE FOURTH BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the life of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">What use the Aire is for as to the life of things.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_029_n.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="N" /></div>

<p>o man can deny that Aire gives life to all
things, bodies, and substances, that are
produced, and generated of the Earth.
Now you must know what, and what
manner of thing the life of every thing in particular
is; <span class="sidenote">What the life of things is.</span>and it is nothing else then a spirituall essence, a
thing that is invisible, impalpable, a spirit, and spirituall.
<span class="sidenote">What things have life.</span>Wherefore there is no corporeall thing, which
hath not a spirit lying hid in it, as also a life, which, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30a" id="Page_30a"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
I said before, is nothing but a spirituall thing. For
not only that hath life which moves, and stirres,
as Men, Animalls, Vermine of the earth, Birds in
the Aire, Fish in the sea, but also all corporeall, and
substantiall things. For here wee must know that God
in the beginning of the Creation of all things, created
no body at all without its spirit, which it secretly
contains in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is the difference betwixt the Spirit and the Body.</div>

<p>For what is the body without a spirit? Nothing
at all. Wherefore the spirit contains in it secretly the
vertue, and power of the thing, and not the body.
For in the body there is death, and the body is the
subject of death, neither is any else to be sought for
in the body, but death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spirit never dyes.</div>

<p>For that may severall wayes bee destroyed, and
corrupted, but the spirit cannot. For the living spirit
remains for ever, and also is the subject of life:
and preserves the body alive; but in the ruine of the
body it is separated from it, and leaves behind it a
dead body, and returnes to its place, from whence it
came, <i>viz.</i> into the Chaos, and the Aire of the upper
and lower Firmament. Hence it appears that there
are divers spirits, as well as divers bodies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The division of the Spirit according to the variety of bodies.</div>

<p>For there are spirits Celestiall, Infernall, Humane,
Metalline, Minerall, of Salts, of Gemmes, of Marcasites,
of Arsenicks, of Potable things, of Rootes,
of Juices, of Flesh, of Blood, of Bones, &amp;c. <span class="sidenote">The
Spirit is the life of all Corporeall things.</span>Wherefore
also know that the spirit is most truly the life,
and balsome of all Corporeall things. But now wee
will proceed to the species, and briefly describe to you
in this place the life of every naturall thing in particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31a" id="Page_31a"></a>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of man is.</div>

<p>The life therefore of all men is nothing else but
an Astrall balsome, a Balsamick impression, and a
celestiall invisible Fire, an included Aire, and a tinging
spirit of Salt. I cannot name it more plainly,
although it bee set out by many names. And
seeing wee have declared the best, and chiefest,
wee shall bee silent in these which are lesse materiall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Metalls is.</div>

<p>The life of Metalls is a secret fatnesse, which they
have received from Sulphur, which is manifest by
their flowing, for every thing that flowes in the
fire, flowes by reason of that secret fatnesse that is
in it: unlesse that were in it, no Metall could flow,
as wee see in Iron, and Steel, which have lesse
Sulphur, and fatnesse then all the other Metalls,
wherefore they are of a dryer Nature then all the
rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Mercury is.
Mercury is like to a garment of skins.</div>

<p>The life of Mercury is nothing else but the internall
heat, and externall coldnesse, <i>i.e.</i> it makes the
internall part of its body hot, and the outward
part cold, and therefore might well bee compared
to a garment made of skins, which doth even
as Mercury make hot, and cold. For if a man
wears such a garment it makes him warme, and
keeps him from the cold: but if the smooth part
of those skins bee put upon his naked body, it
makes him cold, and is good against too much
heat; wherefore it was a custome in ancient time,
and still is in some places, to weare skins as well in
Summer, as in Winter, as against cold in the
one, so against heat in the other: in Summer they
turn the smooth side inward, and the hairy side
outward; and in Winter the hairy side inward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32a" id="Page_32a"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
the smooth side outward. As therefore you have
heard of the garment of skins, so also it may bee
said of Mercury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Sulphur is.</div>

<p>The life of Sulphur is a combustible, stinking fatnesse,
for whilst it burns, and stinks, it may be said to
be alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Salts is.</div>

<p>Now the life of all Salts is nothing else but the
spirit of <i>Aquæ fortis</i>: for that water being drawne
from them, that which remains in the bottome, is
called Dead earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Gemmes and Coralls is.</div>

<p>The life of Gemmes, and Coralls is only their
colour, which with spirit of Wine may be taken from
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Pearls is.</div>

<p>The life of Pearls is nothing else but their splendor,
which they lose in calcination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of the Loadstone is.</div>

<p>The life of the Loadstone is the spirit of Iron,
which may bee extracted, and taken away with spirit
of Wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Flints what.</div>

<p>The life of Flintes is a mucilaginous matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Marcasites what.</div>

<p>The life of Marcasites, Cachymia, Talcum,
Cobaltum, Zimri, Granata, Wismat, and of Antimony
is a tinging Metalline spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Arsenicks.</div>

<p> life of Arsenickes, Auripigment, Operment,
Realgar, and such like matters, is a Minerall, and coagulated
poison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Excremeuts">Excrements</span></div>

<p>The life of Excrements, <i>i.e.</i> of mans dung, or beast
dung is their stinking smell, for this being lost they
are dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of aromaticall things.</div>

<p>The life of Aromaticall things, <i>viz.</i> of Muske,
Amber Gryse, Civet, and whatsoever yeelds a
strong, good, and sweet smell is nothing else
but that gratefull odour: for if they lose this they are
dead and of no use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33a" id="Page_33a"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of sweet things.</div>

<p>The life of sweet things, as of Sugar, Honey,
Manna, Cassia, and such like is in their tinging, and subtile
sweetnesse, for if that sweetnesse bee taken from
them by distilling, or subliming they are dead, unprofitable,
and nothing worth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Rozzens.</div>

<p>The life of all Rozzens, as Amber, Turpentine,
Gumme, is the muciliginous shining fatnesse, which
gives that excellent vernish to them all: for when
they will yeeld no more vernish, and lose their shining,
they are dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Plants.</div>

<p>The life of Hearbs, Roots, Apples, and other such
like fruit, is nothing else but the liquor of the Earth,
which they lose of their own accord, if they do but
want water, and Earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Wood.</div>

<p>The life of Wood is a certaine Rozzen, for
any wood if it want Rozzen can live no longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of Bones.</div>

<p>The life of Bones is the liquor of Mummie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of flesh.</div>

<p>The life of flesh, and blood is nothing else but the
spirit of Salt, which preserves them from stinking,
and putrefaction, and is of it selfe as water separated
from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life of every Element.</div>

<p>Now concerning the life of Elements, you must
know that the life of Water is its running. For
when by the coldnesse of the Firmament it is congealed
into ice, it is dead, and its mischievousnesse
is taken from it, that nobody can bee drowned
in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Fire is.</div>

<p>The life of Fire is Aire, for Aire makes fire burne
with greater vehemency, and heate: Also there
cometh forth from all Fire a kind of Aire, which
will blow out a candle, and drives up a feather, as
you may dayly see before your eyes. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34a" id="Page_34a"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
the flame of Fire is choaked if it bee so stopt up,
that it can neither receive in Aire, and let out its own
Aire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Aire is.</div>

<p>The Aire lives by, and of it selfe, and gives life to all
other things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the life of Earth is.</div>

<p>The earth of it selfe is dead, but the Element of it
is an invisible, and secret life.</p>

<i>THE FIFTH BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Death, or ruine of all
things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">What Death is.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_035_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" /></div>

<p>he death of all naturall things is nothing
else but an alteration and destruction of
their powers, and vertues, a predominancy
of that which is evill, and an overcoming
of what is good, an abolishing of the former nature,
and generation of a new, and another nature. For
you must know that there are many things that,
whilst they are alive, have in them severall vertues,
but when they are dead retaine little or nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36a" id="Page_36a"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
their vertue, but become unsavory, and unprofitable.
So on the contrary many things, whilest they
live, are bad, but after they are dead, and corrupted,
manifest a manifold power, and vertue, and are very
usefull. Wee could bring many examples to confirme
this, but that doth not belong to our purpose.
But that I may not seem to write according
to mine own opinion only, but out of my experience,
it will bee necessary that I produce one
example, with which I shall silence those Sophisters,
who say, that wee can receive nothing from dead
things, neither must we seek, or expect to find any
thing in them. The reason is, because they do esteem
nothing of the preparations of Alchymists, by which
many such like great secrets are found out. For looke
upon Mercury, crude Sulphur, and crude Antimony,
as they are taken out of their Mines, <i>i.e.</i> whilest they
are living, and see what little vertue there is in them,
how slowly they put forth their vertues, yea they do
more hurt, then good, and are rather poison, then a
Medicine. <span class="sidenote">The preparation of Mercury Sulphur
and Antimony.</span>But if through the industry of a skilfull
Alchymist, they bee corrupted in their first substance,
and wisely prepared (<i>viz.</i> if Mercury be coagulated,
precipitated, sublimed, dissolved, and turned into an
oyle, if Sulphur bee sublimed, calcined, reverberated,
and turned into an oyle; also if Antimony bee
sublimed, calcined, and reverberated and turned into
oyle) you shall see how usefull they are, how much
strength, and vertue they have, and how quickly
they put forth, and shew their efficacy, which no man
is able to speak enough in the commendation of, or
to describe. For many are their vertues, yea more
then will ever bee found out by any man. Wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37a" id="Page_37a"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
let every faithfull Alchymist, and Physitian spend
their whole lives in searching into these three: For
they will abundantly recompense him for all his labour,
study, and costs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the Death of man is.</div>

<p>But to come to particulars, and to write particularly
of the death, and destruction of every naturall
thing, and what the death of every thing is, and after
what manner every thing is destroyed; you must
know therefore in the first place, that the death of
man is without doubt nothing else, but an end of his
daily work, the taking away of the Aire, the decaying
of the Naturall balsome, the extinguishing of
the naturall light, and the great separation of the
three substances, <i>viz.</i> the body, soule, and spirit,
and their return from whence they came. For because
a naturall man is of the earth, the Earth also
is his Mother, into which hee must return, and there
must lose his natural earthly flesh, and so be regenerated
at the last day in a new celestiall, and purified
flesh, as Christ said to <i>Nicodemus</i> when hee came to
him by night. For thus must these words bee understood
of regeneration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the destruction of Metalls is.</div>

<p>The death, and destruction of Metalls is the disjoining
of their bodies, and sulphureous fatnesse,
which may bee done severall ways, as by calcination,
reverberation, dissolution, cementation, and sublimation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcination of Metalls is manifold.</div>

<p>But the calcination of Metalls is not of one sort:
for one is made with Salt, another with Sulphur, another
with <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and another with common
Sublimate, and another with Quicksilver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Calcination with Salt is.</div>

<p>Calcination with Salt is that the Metall be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38a" id="Page_38a"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
into very thin plates, and strowed with Salt, and cemented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcination with Sulphur.</div>

<p>Calcination with Sulphur is, that the Metall bee
made into thin plates, and strowed with Sulphur, and
reverberated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcination with Aqua fortis.</div>

<p><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Calcinaion">Calcination</span> with <i>Aqua fortis</i>, is that the Metall
bee made very small, and dissolved in <i>Aqua fortis</i>,
and precipitated in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcination with Sublimate.</div>

<p>Calcination with sublimed Mercury is this, that
the Metall bee made into thin plates, and that the
Mercury bee put into an earthen vessell narrow towards
the top, and wide at the bottome; and then
let it be set into a gentle fire made with coales, which
must bee blowed a little untill the Mercury begin to
fume, and a white cloud goe forth of the mouth of
the vessel, then let the Plate of the Metall bee put
into the top of the vessel, and so the sublimed Mercury
wil penetrate the Metall, and make it as brittle
as a stone of coal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcination with Quicksilver.</div>

<p>Calcination with Quicksilver, is that the Metall
bee made very small, and thin, and be amalgamated
with Quicksilver, and afterward the Quicksilver
bee strained through Leather, and the Metall remain
in the Leather like chalke, or sand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divers other sorts of mortification of metalls.</div>

<p>Now besides these mortifications of Metalls, and
destructions of their lives, know also that there are
yet more. For rust is the death of all Iron, and Steel,
and all vitriall, burnt brasse is mortified Copper: all
precipitated, sublimated, calcined Cinnabar is mortified
Mercury, all Ceruse, and Minium of Lead is
mortified Lead; all Lazure is mortified Silver: also all
Gold from which its tincture, Quintessence, Rozzen,
Crocus, Vitriall, or Sulphur is extracted, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39a" id="Page_39a"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
dead, because it hath no more the form of Gold,
but is a white Metall like fixed Silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A two fold preparation of Crocus Martis.</div>

<p>But let us proceed to shew how Metalls may bee
yet further mortified. First therefore of Iron, know
that that is mortified, and reduced into Crocus this
way. Make Steel into very thin plates: Make these
plates red hot, and quench them in the best Wine-Vineger,
doe this so often til the Vineger hath contracted
a considerable rednesse, then distil of the Vineger,
til there bee nothing but a dry powder remaining.
This is a most excellent Crocus Martis.</p>

<p>There is also another way of making Crocus
Martis, which doth partly exceed the former, and is
made with farre lesse costs, and pains, and it is
this.</p>

<p>Strow upon the plates of <i>S</i>teel, <i>S</i>ulphur, and
Tartar, being both in a like quantity; then reverberate
them, and this wil produce a most excellent
Crocus, which must bee taken off from the
plates.</p>

<p>Also you must know, that every plate of Iron,
or Steel, if it bee melted with <i>Aqua fortis</i>; will also
make a very fair Crocus; so also it is made with oyle
of Vitriall, spirit of <i>S</i>alt, Allum water, the water
of <i>S</i>alt Armoniacke, and of <i>S</i>alt Nitre; as also
with sublimated Mercury, all which mortifie Iron,
and bring it into a Crocus; but none of these
latter wayes is to bee compared to the two former,
for they are only used in Alchymie, and
not at all in Physicke; wherefore in this, use
only the two former, and let alone the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40a" id="Page_40a"></a>[Pg 40]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The mortification of Copper.</div>

<p>The mortification of Copper, <i>viz.</i> that it may be
reduced into Vitriall, Verdegrease, <span class="sidenote">The Vitriall
of Copper is made two wayes.</span>may bee done
many wayes, and there are more processes in it, yet
one far better then another, and one more profitable
then another. Wherefore it is most convenient here to
set down the best, and most profitable, and to bee
silent in the rest. The best therefore, the most easy, and
exactest way of reducing Copper into Vitriall is this.</p>

<p>Let plates of Copper bee dipt in spirit of <i>S</i>alt,
or Salt-Petre, and let them bee hanged in the Aire
until they begin to be green, which indeed wil <span class="correction" title="In the original book: quickty">quickly</span>
be, wash off this greennesse with cleer fountaine-water,
dry the plates with some cloath, and wet them
again with the spirit of <i>S</i>alt, and <i>S</i>alt Nitre, and do
again as before, so long until the water bee apparently
green, or much Vitriall swim on the top:
then poure away the water, or evaporate it, and thou
hast a most excellent Vitriall for medicine. In Alchymie
there is not a fairer, more excellent, and better
Vitriall then what is made by <i>Aqua fortis</i>, or <i>Aqua
regis</i>, or spirit of <i>S</i>alt Armoniacke. And the processe
is this.</p>

<p>Let plates of Copper be melted with one of the aforesaid
waters, &amp; as soon as the greeness is extracted,
and the plates dryed, let the greeness be taken off with
the foot of a Hare, or some other way as you please,
as Ceruse is taken off from the plates of Lead: let
them bee again wetted as before, until the plates bee
wholly consumed, thereby is made a most glorious
Vitriall, that thou canst not choose but wonder at
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How water of Salt-petre and Salt-armoniack is made.</div>

<p>The water of Salt Petre is made thus. Purifie, and
powder it; afterwards dissolve it of it selfe in a blad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41a" id="Page_41a"></a>[Pg 41]</span>der,
put in boyling water. So thou shalt have
the water of Salt Petre.</p>

<p>The water of Salt Armoniacke is made thus: Calcine
Salt Armoniack, and dissolve it in a Cellar
upon a Marble, and this is water of Salt Armoniack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Verdegrease may be made two wayes.</div>

<p>But to make Verdegrease out of Copper, there are
divers wayes which it is not needful here to recite.
Wee shall describe only two, but with a double preparation,
<i>viz.</i> The one for Physicke, the other for
Alchymie. The processe therefore of Verdegrease
to be used in Physick is this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How verdegrease to be used in physick
is to be prepared.</div>

<p>Take plates of Copper, which wet over with the
following matter. Take Honey, and Vineger, of
each a like quantity, of Salt as much as wil serve to
make them up into a thick past. Mixe them well together,
then put them into a reverberatory, or Potters
furnace so long as the Potter is burning his pots,
and thou shalt see the matter that stickes to the
plates to bee very black, but let not that trouble thee.
For if thou settest those plates in the Aire, all the
black matter wil in a few days become green, and
become a most excellent Verdegrease, <span class="sidenote">The Balsom of
Copper.</span>which may
bee called the Balsome of Copper, and is commended
by all Physitians. But neverthelesse do not thou
wonder that this Verdegrease becomes green in the
Aire, and that the Aire can change the black colour
into so fair a green.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aire changeth the Colours of things burnt.</div>

<p>For here thou must know that daily experience in
Alchymie doth shew, that any dead earth, or <i>Caput
Mortuum</i>, as soon as it comes out of the Fire into the
Aire, doth quickly get another colour, and leaves its
own colour which it got in the fire. For the changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42a" id="Page_42a"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
of those colours are various. For as the matter is, so
are the colours that are made, although for the most
part they flow from the blacknesse of the dead earth.
For you that are skilful in Alchymie see that the dead
earth of <i>Aqua fortis</i> comes black from the Fire, and
by how many more ingredients there bee in it,
by so much the more variously doe the colours
shew themselves in the Aire: sometimes they seem
red, as Vitriall makes them: sometimes yellow,
white, green, blew: sometimes mixt, as in the Rainbow,
or Peacocks taile. All those <span class="correction" title="In the original book: cololours">colours</span> shew
themselves after the death, and by the death of
the matter. For in the death of all naturall
things here are seen other colours, which are changed
from the first colour into other colours, every one
according to its nature, and property.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preparation of Verdegrease to be used in Alchymie.</div>

<p>Now we wil speak of that Verdegrease which is to
bee used in Alchymie. The preparation, and processe
of that is this.</p>

<p>Make very thin plates of Copper, strow upon them
Salt, Sulphur, and Tartar ground, and mixed together,
of each a like quantity in a great calcining pot.
Then reverberate them twenty foure houres with a
strong Fire, but so that the plates of Copper do not
melt, then take them out, and break the pot, and set
the plates with the matter that sticks to them into
the Aire for a few dayes, and the matter upon the
plates wil bee turned into a faire Verdegrease, which
in all sharp Corroding waters, waters of Exaltation,
and in Cements, and in colouring of Gold, doth tinge
Gold, and Silver with a most deep colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Æs vstum, or Crocus of Copper is to be made.</div>

<p>Now to turne Copper into <i>Æs ustum</i>, which
is called the <i>Crocus</i> of Copper, the processe is
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43a" id="Page_43a"></a>[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Let Copper be made into thin plates, and be smeered
over with Salt made into a past with the best Vineger,
then let it be put into a great Crucible, and
set in a wind furnace, and be burnt in a strong Fire
for a quarter of an houre, but so that the plates melt
not: let these plates being red hot bee quenched in
Vineger, in which Salt Armoniack is dissolved, alwaies
half an ounce in a pint of Vineger; let the plates
bee made red hot again, and quenched in Vineger as
before, alwaies scraping, or knocking off the scales
which stick to the plates after quenching, into the
Vineger. Do this so long, until the plates of Copper
bee in good part consumed by this means: then distil
off the Vineger, or let it vapour away in an open
vessel, and bee coagulated into a most hard stone. So
thou hast the best <i>Crocus</i> of Copper, the use whereof
is in Alchymie. Many make <i>Crocus</i> of Copper by extracting
of it with the spirit of Wine, or Vineger, as
they do <i>Crocus Martis</i>: But I commend this way far
above it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sublimation of Quicksilver.</div>

<p>Now the mortification of Quicksilver that it may
bee sublimed, is made with Vitriall, and Salt, with
which it is mixed, and then sublimed, so it becomes
as hard as Crystall, and as white as snow: but to bring
it to a Precipitate, the processe is this:</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to make a fixt Precipitat Diaphoreticall.</div>

<p>Let it first be calcined with the best <i>Aqua fortis</i>, then
distil off the <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and do this about five times,
until the Precipitate become to bee of a faire red colour:
Dulcifie this precipitate as much as thou canst:
And lastly poure upon it the best rectified spirit of
Wine you can get, distil it off from it eight, or nine
times, or so often until it be red hot in the fire, and
doe not fly: then thou hast a Diaphoretical precipitated
Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44a" id="Page_44a"></a>[Pg 44]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How to make a sweet Precipitate.</div>

<p>Moreover, you must take notice of a great secret
concerning precipitated Mercury, <i>viz.</i> if after it is
coloured, it bee dulcified with water of salt of Tartar,
pouring it upon it, and distilling of it off so often, until
the water riseth no more sharp from the Precipitate,
but bee manifestly sweet; <span class="sidenote">And the use of it.</span>then thou hast a precipitate
as sweet as sugar, or honey, which in all wounds,
Ulcers, and Venereal Disease is so excellent a secret,
that no Physitian need desire a better.</p>

<p>Besides it is a great comfort to despairing Alchymists.
For it doth augment Gold, and hath ingresse
into Gold, and with it Gold remaines stable, and
good. Although there is much pains, and sweat required
to this Precipitate, yet it wil sufficiently recompense
thee for thy pains, and costs; and wil yeeld thee
more gain, then can bee got by any Art or Trade
whatsoever: Thou maist wel therefore rejoice in this,
and give God, and mee thanks for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Quicksilver may be Coagulated.</div>

<p>Now that Quicksilver may bee coagulated, I said
that that must bee done in sharp <i>Aqua fortis</i>, which
must bee drawn off by Distillation, and then the Precipitate
is made. <span class="sidenote">How Quicksilver may be turned to Cinnabar.</span>But that Quicksilver may bee
brought into a Cinnabar; you must first mortifie, and
melt it with Salt, and yellow Sulphur, and bring it
into a white powder, then put it in a gourd, and put
upon it Aludel, or head, and sublime it in the greatest
flux you can, as the manner is, so the Cinnabar will
ascend into the Aludel, and stick as hard as the stone
<i>Hæmatites</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There are two kinds of Ceruse.</div>

<p>The mortification of Lead to bring it to a Ceruse,
is twofold; the one for Medicine, the other for Alchymie.
<span class="sidenote">The preparation of them.</span>The preparation of Ceruse for Medicine is
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45a" id="Page_45a"></a>[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Hang plates of Lead in a glazed pot over strong
Wine-vinegar, the pot being well stopt that the spirits
doe not exhale: put this pot into warm ashes, or
in the Winter into a furnace, then alwaies after ten or
fourteen dayes, thou shalt find very good Ceruse
sticking to the plates, which strike off with the foot
of a Hare: then put the plates over the Vineger again,
untill thou hast enough Ceruse.</p>

<p>Now the other preparation of Ceruse for Alchymie
is like the former, only that in the Vineger must
bee dissolved a good quantity of the best, and fairest
Salt Armoniack, for by this means thou shalt purchase
a most faire, and beautifull Ceruse, for the purging
of Tinne, and Lead, and the whitening of Copper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preparation of Minium out of Lead.</div>

<p>But if wee would make Minium of Lead, we must
first calcine it with Salt into Calx, and then burn it in
a glazed vessel, alwaies stirring it with an Iron rod, till
it be red. This is the best, and chiefest Minium, and it
is to be used as wel in Physick as Alchymie: but the
other which Mercers sell in their shops is nothing
worth. It is made only of the ashes, which remaine of
the Lead in the melting of it, which also Potters use
to glaze their vessels, and such Minium is used
for Painting, but not for Physicke, or Alchymie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Crocus of Lead.</div>

<p>Now that Lead may bee brought into yellownesse,
the preparation of it is not unlike to the preparation
of Minium. For Lead must here be calcined
with Salt, and brought to a Calx, and afterwards be
stirred with an Iron rod in a Broad bason, such as tryers
of Mineralls use, in a gentle Fire of Coales, diligently
taking heed, that there be not too much heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46a" id="Page_46a"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
nor a neglect in stirring, for else it will flow, and become
a yellow glasse. And so thou hast a fair, yellow
<i>Crocus</i> of Lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Azure Colour is made of silver.</div>

<p>The mortification of Silver, that of it may be made
the Azure colour, or something like to it, is
thus:</p>

<p>Take plates of Silver, and mix them with Quicksilver,
and hang them in a glazed pot over the best Vineger,
in which Gilt-heads have been first boiled, and
afterward Salt Armoniack, and calcined Tartar have
been dissolved; in all the rest doe as hath been said
of Ceruse, then alwaies after fourteen days thou shalt
have a most excellent, and faire Azure colour sticking
to the plates of Silver, which must be wiped off
with a Hares foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Gold.</div>

<p>The Mortification of Gold that it may <span class="correction" title="In the original book: he">be</span> brought
into its Arcana, as into a Tincture, Quintessence,
Resine, Crocus, Vitriall, and Sulphur, and many
other excellent Arcana, which preparations indeed
are many. But because for the most part wee have
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: snfficiently">sufficiently</span> treated of such Arcana in other bookes,
as the extraction of the Tincture of Gold, the Quintessence
of Gold, the Mercury of Gold, the Oile of
Gold, Potable Gold, the Resine of Gold, the Crocus
of Gold, and in the Archidoxis, and elsewhere, wee
conceive it needlesse here to repeat them. But what
Arcana were there omitted, wee shall here set down,
As the Vitriall of Gold, Sulphur of Gold, which indeed
are not the least, and ought very much to cheer
up every Physitian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the sulphur, and the Vitriall of Gold are made.</div>

<p>But to extract Vitriall out of Gold, the processe
is this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47a" id="Page_47a"></a>[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>Take of pure Gold two, or three pound, which
beat into thin plates, and hanging them over Boyes
urine, mixt with the stones of grapes, in a large gourd
glasse, well closed, which bury in a hot heap of stones
of Grapes, as they come from the presse; when it
hath stood fourteen dayes, or three weeks, then open
it, and thou shalt find a most subtil colour, which is
the Vitriall of Gold sticking to the plates of Gold,
which take off with the foot of a Hare, as thou hast
heard concerning other Metalls; as of the plates of
Iron, Crocus Martis, of the plates of Copper, the
Vitriall of Copper and Verdegrease, of the plates of
Lead, Ceruse, of the plates of Silver the Azure colour,
&amp;c. comprehended under one processe, but not
with one manner of preparation. When thou hast
enough of the Vitriall of Gold; boyle it well in
Rain-water distilled, alwaies stirring it with a spatle,
then the sulphur of the gold is driven up to the superficies
of the water, as fat, which take off with a spoon:
Thus also doe with more Vitriall. Now after all
the Sulphur is taken off, evaporate that raine water
til it bee all dry, and there will remain the Vitriall
of Gold in the bottome, which thou maist easily
dissolve of it selfe upon a marble in a moist place. In
these two Arcana’s, <i>viz.</i> the Vitriall of Gold, and
the Sulphur of Gold lies the Diaphoreticall vertue.
I shal not here set down their vertues; for in the book
of Metallick Diseases, and also in other bookes wee
have set them down at large.</p>

<p>The mortification of Sulphur, that the combustible
and stinking fatnesse may bee taken away, and it
brought into a fixed substance, is thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48a" id="Page_48a"></a>[Pg 48]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The mortification and fixation of Sulphur.</div>

<p>Take common yellow Sulphur finely powdered,
and draw from it by distillation <i>Aqua fortis</i>, that is
very sharp, and this doe three times, then the Sulphur
which is in the bottome of a black colour dulcifie
with distilled water, until the water come from it
sweet, and it retains no more the stink of Sulphur.
Then reverberate this Sulphur in a close reverberatory
as you doe Antimony, then it will first be white,
then yellow, and lastly as red as Cinnabar. And when
it is so, then thou maist rejoice: For it is the beginning
of thy riches: This reverberated Sulphur tingeth
Silver most deeply into most excellent Gold, and the
body of Man into most perfect health. This reverberated,
and fixed Sulphur is of more vertue then it is
lawfull to speak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Salts.</div>

<p>The mortification of all Salts, and whatsoever is
saltish, is the taking away, and distilling off the
aquosity, and oylinesse, and of the spirit of them. For
if these be taken away, they are afterwards called the
dead Earth, or <i>Caput Mortuum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Gemmes.</div>

<p>The mortification of Gemmes, and Coralls, is
to calcine, sublime, and dissolve them into a liquor,
as Crystall. The mortification of Pearls is to calcine
them, and dissolve them in sharp Vineger into the
form of Milke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of the Loadstone.</div>

<p>The mortification of the Loadstone, is to anoint it
with the oyle of Mercury, or to put it into Quicksilver,
for afterward it will not draw Iron at all
to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of flints and stones.</div>

<p>The mortification of Flints, and Stones, is to
calcine them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Marcasites.</div>

<p>The mortification of Marcasites, Cachyma’s,
Talke, Cobaltus, Zinri, Granuti, <span class="correction" title="See Transcriber’s Note.">Zunitter</span>, Unismut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49a" id="Page_49a"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
and of Antimony is their Sublimation, <i>i.e.</i> that
they bee sublimed with Salt, and Vitriall, then their
life which is a Metallick spirit, together with the spirit
of Salt, ascends. And let whatsoever remains
in the bottome of the Sublimatory, bee washed,
that the Salt may bee dissolved from it, and then
thou hast a dead Earth, in which there is no vertue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Realgar.</div>

<p>The mortification of Arsenickes, Auripigment,
Operment, Realgar, &amp;c. is, that they flow with Salt
Nitre, and bee turned into an Oyl, or Liquor upon a
Marble, and be fixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of excrements.</div>

<p>The mortification of Excrements, is the coagulation
of Aire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mortification of Aromatical things.</div>

<p>The mortification of Aromaticall things is the taking
away of their good smell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Sweet things.</div>

<p>The mortification of sweet things, is to sublime
and distill them with corrosive things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Resines.</div>

<p>The mortification of Ambers, Resines, Turpentine,
Gumme, and such like, is to turn them into Oyle, and
Vernish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Hearbs and Roots.</div>

<p>The mortification of Hearbs, Roots, and such like,
is to distil off from them their oyle, and water, and
presse out their liquor with a presse, and also to make
their Alcali.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Wood.</div>

<p>The mortification of Wood, is to turne it into
Coales, and Ashes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Bones.</div>

<p>The mortification of Bones, is their Calcination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Flesh.</div>

<p>The mortification of Flesh, and Blood, is the taking
away of the spirit of Salt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Water.</div>

<p>The mortification of Water is by Fire, for all heat
dries up, and consumes water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Fire.</div>

<p>The mortification of Fire is by Water, for all Water,
quencheth Fire, and takes from it its power, and
force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50a" id="Page_50a"></a>[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>So now you are sufficiently instructed in few
words how death lyes hid in all naturall things, and
how they may be mortified, and bee brought into
another form, and nature, and what vertues flow from
them. Whatsoever should have been said further, we
put in the following book, of the Resurrection of Naturall
things.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_051_t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="T" /></div>

<p>he Resurrection, and renewing of Naturall
things, is not the least, but a profound,
and great secret in the Nature of things,
and rather Divine, and Angelicall, then
Humane, and Naturall.</p>

<p>I desire to bee here understood with great distinction,
and no otherwise then my opinion is, and
Nature doth daily, and manifestly shew, and experience
make good, lest I should bee exposed to the lies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52a" id="Page_52a"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
and slanders of Mountebankes, my enemies (which
doe construe all that I doe in the worst sense) as if I
would usurp the Divine power, and attribute this to
Nature, which shee was never able to performe:
Wherefore wee must cautiously consider that there is
a twofold Death, <i>viz.</i> violent, and voluntary.
<span class="sidenote">Death is twofold.</span>
The one can raise a thing again, the other not. Wherefore,
doe not beleeve those Sophisters that say, that a thing
that is once dead, or mortified, can never bee raised
again, and that make no account of resuscitation, and
restauration of things, which error indeed of theirs is
not the least. And indeed it is true, that whatsoever
dyeth, or perisheth with a naturall death, and what
Nature mortifies by reason of her predestination,
God alone can raise again, or must of necessity bee
done by his command: so whatsoever Nature destroyes,
Man cannot restore again. <span class="sidenote">What things may
be raised againe.</span>But whatsoever
Man destroyes hee can restore again, and being restored
spoil again, and Man hath no further power of
himselfe, and if hee should attempt to doe any thing
more, hee would arrogate the power of God to himselfe,
and yet hee would labour in vain, and be confounded,
unlesse God did assist him, or hee had so
much faith as to remove mountains: Even to such a
man, this is possible, and greater things then this.
Because the Scripture saith, and Christ himselfe
spake it. If thou hast faith as a grain of Mustard-seed,
and saist unto this Mountaine, Goe and
bee removed thither, and it shall bee removed, and
all things bee possible to thee, and nothing impossible.</p>

<p>But to return to our purpose, what difference then
there is betwixt dying, and being mortified, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53a" id="Page_53a"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
which of these may be raised again, so these are to
bee understood. Whatsoever naturally dies hath
its end by predestination, and so the will and ordination
of God permits. <span class="sidenote">What things can not be raised againe.</span>Yet it happens that this is
also done by divers diseases, and various casualties, and
this can never be raised again, neither is there any preservative
to bee used against predestination, and the
naturall term of life. But that which is mortified,
may bee both raised again, and revived, which may
bee proved by divers arguments, which wee shall set
down in the end of this book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is one thing to Dye, and other thing to be Mortified.</div>

<p>Wherefore there is a great difference betwixt dying,
and being mortified, neither must they bee taken
for one, and the same things, under the same name.
For in the very example they are far different. For
look upon a man that dies a naturall, and predestinated
death, what further good, or profit is there in
him? Nothing, hee is only cast into the earth to
worms. For hee is a stinking carkasse, and due to
the earth.</p>

<p>But the same is not to be understood of a man that
is slain with a sword, or dies by some such like violent
death. For his whole body is profitable, and
good, and may bee prepared into a most pretious
Mummie. For although the spirit of life went out of
such a body, yet the balsome in which lies the life
remains, which indeed doth as balsome preserve other
mens bodies.</p>

<p>So you may see in Metalls, when a Metall is about
to die, it begins to bee overcome with rust, and as
much as is thus overcome, is dead: and when all the
Metall is devoured with rust, it is all dead, and such a
rust can never bee reduced into true Metall againe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54a" id="Page_54a"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
but it becomes only drosse, and not a Metall. For <span class="correction" title="In the original book: it it">it</span>
is dead, and death is in it, neither hath it any
more balsome of life, but is quite destroyed in it
selfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The difference betwixt the Calx of Metalls, and their ashes.</div>

<p>Now the Calx of Metalls, and their ashes are two
things: And there is a great difference betwixt these
two, for one may be revived, and brought back again
into a Metall, but the other not: the one is volatile,
the other fixed, the one died, the other mortified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the Ashes of Metalls is.</div>

<p>The Ashes is volatile, and cannot be brought back
into a Metall, only into glasse, and drosse: but the
Calx of Metals is fixed, and maybe be brought back
into its own Metall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the Calx of Metalls is.</div>

<p>But to understand the difference, and the cause,
know, that in the Ashes there is lesse fatnesse, and
more drynesse then in the Calx, which indeed makes
it fluxil: but the Calx is fatter, and moister, then
the Ashes, and doth still retain its refine, and fluxibleness,
and especially the Salt, which naturally is fluxil,
and makes Metalls flow, and reduceth them. Hence
now it follows, that the Salt must bee extracted out
of the Ashes of Metals, that they may not be brought
back into a Metal, then they are perfectly volatile; and
this difference, and this clause is chiefly to bee taken
notice of, for much depends upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The errours of Mountebankes concerning Gold.</div>

<p>For amongst Mountebankes this is no small error,
who in stead of Potable Gold, the Quintessence of
Gold, Tincture of Gold, &amp;c. have given to men an
impure Calx of Gold, not considering the difference,
and evill that follows upon it. For there are two remarkable,
and necessary things to be taken notice of
here, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55a" id="Page_55a"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>First, that Gold calcined, or powdered, if it be given
to Men, is gathered into one heap in the stomach,
or goeth forth again with the dung, and so it is
taken in vain, without doing any good: or that which
is reduced by the great inward heat in mans body,
it gilds over, and makes hard in a crust, both the
bowells, and stomach, by reason of which the concoction
of the stomach is hindred, whence many, and
various sicknesses follow, and at length death it
selfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When Metallike Arcana are to be taken inwardly.</div>

<p>As you have heard of Gold, so also must it bee
understood of all the other Metalls, <i>viz.</i> that you
take not any Metallick <i>Arcanum</i>, or Medicine into
your body, unlesse it bee first made volatile, and it be
reduced into no Metall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to make Metalls Potable and Irreducible.</div>

<p>Wherefore the first degree, and beginning to
prepare Potable Gold is this: so may such a Volatile
bee afterwards dissolved in spirit of Wine, that both
may ascend together, bee made volatil, inseparable.
And as you prepare Gold, so may you also prepare
potable <span class="not-mobile">☽</span><span class="mobile-only">[Moon]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♃</span><span class="mobile-only">[Jupiter]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span> and <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The raising againe of things is proved by the
Whelpes of a Lyon.</div>

<p>But to return to our purpose, let us prove by examples,
and sufficient reasons, that things mortified are
not dead, and forced to abide in death, but may bee
reduced, raised again, and revived, and this truly by
man, and according to the course of Nature. You
see Lions how all of them are brought forth dead,
and first of all are made alive by the horrible roaring
of their Parents, as one that is asleep is raised
with a noise, <span class="sidenote">How Lyons are made alive againe.</span>so also are Lions raised, not that they
are thus asleep. (<span class="correction" title="In the original book: for">For</span> they which sleep a naturall sleep
must of necessity rise again, which the Lions of
themselves doe not.) For if they were not raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56a" id="Page_56a"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
by this roaring, they would remain dead, and life
would never bee perceived in them. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Wheerefore">Wherefore</span> it
is apparent, that by this roaring they receive their
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reviving of dead Flies.</div>

<p>So also you see in all Animalls which are not ingendered,
but proceed from putrefaction, as Flies, which
if they bee drowned in water, that no life at all is
perceived in them, and if they were so left, they would
continue dead, and never return to life of themselves
any more. But if you cast salt upon them, and
put them in the warme Sunne, or behind a warme
furnace, they will recover their former life, and
this truly is a raising of them up againe. For if
this were not done, they would continue dead for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The generation of many Serpents of one.</div>

<p>So also you see in a Serpent, if hee be cut into pieces,
and these pieces put into a gourd glasse, and
bee putrefied in Horse-dung, the whole Serpent
will become living againe in the glasse, in the
form either of Worms, or spawn of Fishes. And if
those Wormes bee in a fitting manner brought out
of putrefaction, and nourished, many hundred Serpents
will be bred out of one Serpent, whereof every
one will be as big as the first, which is done only by
putrefaction. And as it is said of the Serpent, so
also many other Animalls may be raised, and restored
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hermes</i>, and <i>Virgils</i> endeavour
to raise themselves after Death.</div>

<p>According to this processe <i>Hermes</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>
have attempted (by the assistance of Negromancy) to
renew, and raise themselves after death, and to bee
born again as infants, but it succeeded not according
to their purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57a" id="Page_57a"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Resuscitation of Metalls is twofold.</div>

<p>But to omit examples, and fall upon the Praxis of
Resurrection, and Restauration, it is necessary, and
most convenient to begin with Metalls, forasmuch
as Metalline bodies do oftentimes resemble Mens
bodies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reducing of Metalls into Quickesilver.</div>

<p>Wee must know therefore, that the Resurrection,
and Restauration of Metalls is twofold. The
one which doth reduce calcined Metalls into their
first Metallick body: the other which doth reduce
Metalls into their first matter, <i>i.e.</i> into Quicksilver.</p>

<p>The processe of the latter is this: Calcine a Metall
with common Quicksilver, put this Calx, and as
much Quicksilver into a Sublimatory, and let them
stand so long till both be coagulated into an Amalgama;
then sublime the Mercury from the Calx, then
grind it again with the Metallick Calx, and sublime it
as before, this do so often, till the Metallick Calx shal
over a candle melt like wax, or ice, and then it is well
done. Put this Metall in digestion for a time, and it wil
all be turned into Quicksilver, <i>i.e.</i> into its first matter,
which Mercury of Metalls is indeed called the Mercury
of Philosophers, which many Alchymists have
sought after, but few have found. Now after
this manner may Quicksilver bee prepared out of
all Metalls, <i>viz.</i> <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> <i>auri</i>, <span class="not-mobile">☽</span><span class="mobile-only">[Moon]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♃</span><span class="mobile-only">[Jupiter]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reduction of Sublimate, and the highest purging of it.</div>

<p>Now the raising again, or restoring of coagulated
Mercury is done by distillation in a retort: for
Quicksilver alone ascends into cold water, the Ashes
of <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span> or Sulphur being left behind.</p>

<p>Now the raising again, or restauration of Mercury
sublimed is done in seething hot water: but it must first
be ground very small, so the hot water wil seperates it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58a" id="Page_58a"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
from it the spirit of Salt, and Vitriall, which it carries
up with it, the quicksilver running in the bottome
of the water. Now if this Quicksilver shall be again
sublimed with Salt, and Vitriall, and revived againe
in Hot water, and this done seven, or eight
times, it can never bee better purged, and renewed.</p>

<p>And this may bee kept for a great secret in Alchymie,
and Physick, and be much rejoiced in. For
by this means all the impurity, blacknesse, and poisonousnesse
is taken away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reduction of calcined and Precipitated Mercury.</div>

<p>Mercury calcined can never bee restored againe
without sublimation; for unlesse it be sublimed after
calcination, it will never bee revived, wherefore thou
shalt first sublime it, and then reduce it as other Sublimate.</p>

<p>The resuscitation of Azure Cinnabar, <i>Aurum vitæ</i>,
also of Precipitate, that they may bee reduced into
Quicksilver is thus:</p>

<p>Take either of these, grind it small upon a marble,
make it up into a past with the white of an egge, and
sope, then make pills of the bigness of Filbeards,
which put into a strong earthen gourd, upon the
mouth of it put a plate of Iron, with many little holes
in it, and lute it on, and distill it <i>per descensum</i> with
a strong fire, so that it may fall into cold water,
and thou shalt have the Quicksilver again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The renewing of Wood that is burnt.</div>

<p>Now the resuscitation, and restoring of Wood is
hard, and difficult, yet possible to Nature, but
without much skilfulness, and industry it can never
bee done: But to revive it, the processe is
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59a" id="Page_59a"></a>[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Take Wood which must first bee a Coale, then
Ashes, which put into a gourd together with the Resine,
Liquor, and Oyle of that tree, of each a like
weight, mingle them, and melt them with a soft
heat, and there will bee a mucilaginous matter, and
so thou hast the three Principles, of which all things
are produced, and generated, <i>viz.</i> flegm, fatnesse,
and Ashes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The flegme <span class="correction" title="In the original book: of of">of</span> Wood is its Mercury, the
fat its sulphur, the ashes its salt.</div>

<p>The Flegm is Mercury, the Fat is Sulphur, the
Ashes is Salt. For whatsoever fumes, and evaporates
in the Fire is Mercury: whatsoever
flames, and is burnt is Sulphur, and all Ashes is
Salt.</p>

<p>Now seeing thou hast these three Principles together,
put them in Horse-dung, and putrefie them for
a time. If afterward that matter bee put in, and buried
in fat ground, thou shalt see it live again, and a little
tree spring from thence, which truly in vertue is farre
more excellent then the former. This Tree or Wood
is, and is called Regenerated Wood, renewed, and
restored, which from the beginning was Wood, but
mortified, destroyed, and brought into coales, ashes,
and almost to nothing, and yet out of that nothing is
made, and renewed. This truly in the light of Nature
is a great mystery, <i>viz.</i> that a thing, which had
utterly lost its form, and was reduced to nothing,
should recover its form, and of nothing bee made
something, which afterward becomes much more
excellent in vertue, and efficacy then it was at
first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A generall rule for raising of things againe.</div>

<p>But to speake generally of the Resurrection, and
Restauration of Naturall things, you must know, that
the chiefest foundation here, is, that that bee restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60a" id="Page_60a"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
to every thing, and made to agree with it, which was
taken from it in mortification, and separated from it,
which is hard to bee here specifically explained.
Wherefore wee shall conclude this book, and shall
speak of these things more at large in the next book,
Concerning the transmutations of naturall things.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Transmutation of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_061_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>f wee write of the Transmutation of all
Naturall things, it is fit, and necessary that
in the first place wee shew what Transmutation
is. Secondly, what bee the degrees
to it. Thirdly, by what Medium’s, and how it is
done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Transmutation is.</div>

<p>Transmutation therefore is, when a thing loseth
its form, and is so altered, that it is altogether unlike
to its former substance, and form, but assumes ano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62a" id="Page_62a"></a>[Pg 62]</span>ther
form, another essence, another colour, another
vertue, another nature, or property, as if a Metall bee
made glasse, or stone: if a stone bee made a coale: if
wood be made a coal: clay be made a stone, or a brick:
a skin bee made glew: cloth bee made paper, and
many such like things. All these are Transmutations
of Naturall things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There are seven principal degrees of transmutation.</div>

<p>After this, it is very necessary also to know the degrees
to Transmutation, and how many they be. And
they are no more then seven. For although many
doe reckon more, yet there are no more but seven,
which are principall, and the rest may bee reckoned
betwixt the degrees, being comprehended under
those seven: And they are these,</p>

<p class="in2"><i>Calcination, Sublimation, Solution,
Putrefaction, Distillation, Coagulation,
Tincture.</i></p>

<p>If any one will climbe that Ladder, he shall come
into a most wonderfull place, that hee shall see, and
have experience of many secrets in the Transmutation
of Naturall things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Calcination is, and its kinds are.</div>

<p>The first degree therefore is Calcination, under
which also are comprehended Reverberation, and
Cementation. For betwixt these there is but little
difference as for matter of Calcination: Wherefore
it is here the chiefest degree. For by Reverberation,
and Cementation, many corporeall things are calcined,
and brought into Ashes, and especially Metalls.
Now what is calcined is not any further reverberated,
or cemented.</p>

<p>By Calcination therefore all Metalls, Mineralls,
Stones, Glasse, &amp;c. and all corporeall things are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63a" id="Page_63a"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
made a Coal, and Ashes, and this is done by a naked
strong Fire with blowing, by which all tenacious,
soft, and fat earth is hardened into a stone, Also all
stones are brought into a Calx, as wee see in a Potters
furnace of lime, and brickes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Sublimation is, and its kinds.</div>

<p>Sublimation is the second degree, and one of the
most principall for the Transmutation of many Naturall
things: under which is contained Exaltation,
Elevation, and Fixation; and it is not much unlike
Distillation. For as in Distillation the water ascends
from all flegmatick, and watery things, and is separated
from its body; so in Sublimation, that which
is spirituall is raised from what is corporeall, and is
subtilized, volatile from fixed, and that in dry things,
as are all Mineralls, and the pure is separated from the
impure.</p>

<p>Besides Sublimation, many good vertues, and
wonderfull things are found out in Mineralls, and
many things are made fixed, and become constant,
so as to abide in the Fire, and that in this manner.</p>

<p>Let that which is sublimed be ground, and mixed
with its feces, and bee againe sublimed as before,
which must bee done so long, till it will no longer
sublime, but all will remaine together in the bottom,
and bee fixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fixation of Mineralls into a stone.</div>

<p>So there will bee afterward a stone, and oyle when
and as oft as thou pleasest, <i>viz.</i> if thou puttest it <span class="correction" title="In the original book: a-into">into</span>
a cold place, or in the aire in a Glass.
For there it will presently bee dissolved into
an Oyle. And if thou puttest it againe into the
fire, it will againe bee coagulated into a Stone
of wonderfull, and great vertue. Keep this as
a great secret, and mystery of Nature, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64a" id="Page_64a"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
discover it to Sophisters. Moreover, as in Sublimation
many Corrosive things are made sweet in
the conjunction of two matters, so on the contrary,
many sweet things are made Corrosive: many sweet
things are made sowre, harsh, or bitter; and on the
contrary, many bitter things as sweet as Sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rules concerning Salt Armoniack.</div>

<p>Here also wee must take notice, that every Metal
which is brought into Sublimation by Salt Armoniack,
may afterward in the cold, or in the aire bee
brought into an oyle, and againe bee coagulated
into a stone in the Fire, which indeed is one of
the chiefest, and greatest Transmutations in all naturall
things, <i>viz.</i> to transmute Metall into a
Stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Solution is, and its kinds.</div>

<p>The third degree is Solution, under which are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: to to">to</span>
bee understood Dissolution, and Resolution,
and this degree doth most commonly follow
Sublimation, and Distillation, <i>viz.</i> that the
matter be resolved which remaines in the bottome.</p>

<p>Now Solution is twofold: the one of Cold,
the other of Heat; the one without Fire, the
other in Fire.</p>

<p>A cold dissolution dissolves all Salts, all Corrosive
things, &amp; all calcined things. Whatsoever is of a Salt,
and Corrosive quality, is by it dissolved into Oyle,
Liquor, or Water. And this is in a moist, cold cellar,
or else in the Aire on a marble, or in a glasse.
For whatsoever is dissolved in the cold, contains an
Airy spirit of Salt, which oftentimes it gets, and
assumes in Sublimation, or Distillation. And whatsoever
is dissolved in the cold, or in the Aire, may again
by the heat of the Fire bee coagulated into powder,
or a stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65a" id="Page_65a"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What things a hot Solution dissolves.</div>

<p>But a hot Solution dissolves all fat, and sulphureous
things. And whatsoever the heat of the Fire
dissolves, the same doth coldnesse congeal into a
Masse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A double Solution <i>viz.</i> of Heat and Cold.</div>

<p>And whatsoever heat coagulates, is again dissolved
by cold, or in the Aire. Here also we must know
that whatsoever Aire, or the Cellar doth resolve,
is of a very great drynesse, and hath a secret corrosive
Fire hid in it: so whatsoever is dissolved
in Fire, or in the heat thereof, hath a sweetish
frigidity out of the Fire. Thus, and no otherwise is
Solution to be understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Putrefaction what it is, and its kind.</div>

<p>Putrefaction is the fourth degree, under which is
comprehended Digestion, and Circulation.</p>

<p>Now then Putrefaction is one of the principall
degrees, which indeed might deservedly have been
the first of all, but that it would be against the true
order, and mystery, which is here hid, and known
to few: For those degrees must, as hath been already
said, so follow one the other, as links in a chain,
or steps in a ladder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The aforesaid order of Degrees is to be
observed in making tinctures.</div>

<p>For if one of the linkes should bee taken away,
the chain is discontinued, and broken, and the prisoners
would bee at liberty, and runne away. So
in a ladder, if one step bee taken away in the
middle, and bee put in the upper, or lower part,
the ladder would be broken, and many would fall
down headlong by it with the hazard of their bodies,
and lives.</p>

<p>So you must understand the matter here, that those
degrees follow one the other in a just order, or else
the whole work of our mystery would be mar’d, and
our labour, and pains would bee in vain, and fruitlesse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66a" id="Page_66a"></a>[Pg 66]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The force of putrefaction.</div>

<p>Now putrefaction is of such efficacy, that it abolisheth
the old Nature, and brings in a new one.
All living things are killed in it, all dead things
putrefied in it, and all dead things recover life
in it.</p>

<p>Putrefaction takes from all Corrosive spirits, the
sharpnesse <span class="correction" title="In the original book: of of">of</span> the Salt, and makes them mild, and
sweet, changeth the colours, and separates the pure
from the impure, it places the pure above, and the
impure beneath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Distillation is, and its kinds are.</div>

<p>Distillation is the first degree to the Transmutation
of all naturall things. Under it are understood
Ascension, Lavation, and Fixation.</p>

<p>By Distillation all Waters, Liquors, and Oyles
are subtilized out of all fat things. Oyle is extracted,
out of all Liquors, Water, and out of all Flegmaticke
things Water, and Oyle are separated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cohobation.</div>

<p>Besides there are many things in Distillation
fixed by Cohobation, <span class="sidenote">Fixation by
Destillation.</span>and especially if the things
to bee fixed containe in them Water, as Vitriall
doth, which if it bee fixed is called <i>Colcothar</i>.</p>

<p>Allum, if it bee fixed with its proper Water, is
called the Sugar of Allum, which also is resolved
into a Liquor, which Liquor if it bee putrefied a
moneth, produceth a Water of the sweetnesse of
Sugar, which is of great vertue, and an excellent
secret in Physicke, to extinguish any
Metalline heate in Man, as wee have wrote
more at large in our Booke of Metalline Diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67a" id="Page_67a"></a>[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>And as you have heard of Vitriall, and Allum, so
also Salt nitre, and other Watery Mineralls may
bee fixed by Cohobation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Cohobation is.</div>

<p>Now Cohobation is, that the dead head be oftentimes
imbibed with its own water, and that again
bee drawn off by Distillation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The force of Distillation in things to be Transmuted.</div>

<p>Moreover, in Distillation many bitter, harsh, and
sharp things become as sweet as Honey, Sugar, or
Manna; and on the contrary, many sweet things,
as Sugar, Honey, or Manna, may bee made as
harsh as Oyle of Vitriall, or Vineger, or as bitter
as Gall, or Gentian, as Eager, as a Corrosive.</p>

<p>Many Excrementitious things lose their great
stink in Distillation, which indeed goeth forth in
the water.</p>

<p>Many Aromaticall things lose their good savour.</p>

<p>And as Sublimation alters things in their
Quality, and Nature, so also doth Distillation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Coagulation is, and its kinds.</div>

<p>Coagulation is the sixt degree: Now there is a
twofold Coagulation, the one by Cold, the other
by Heat, <i>i.e.</i> one of the Aire, the other of the
Fire: and each of these again is twofold, so that
there are foure sorts of Coagulations, two of Cold,
and two of Fire.</p>

<p>The Coagulations of Fire are fixed, the other of
Cold are not.</p>

<p>The one is done only by common Aire, or without
Fire. The other by the superiour Firmament
of Winter starres, all which coagulate Waters into
snow, and ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68a" id="Page_68a"></a>[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>But the Coagulation of Fire, which alone is here
to bee taken notice of, is made by an Artificiall, and
Graduall Fire of the Alchymists, and it is fixed, and
permanent. For whatsoever such a Fire doth coagulate,
the same abides so.</p>

<p>The other Coagulation is done by the Ætnean,
and Minerall Fire <span class="correction" title="In the original book: in in">in</span> Mountains, which indeed the
Archeius of the Earth governs, and graduates not
unlike to the Alchymists, and whatsoever is coagulated
by such a Fire, is also fixed, and constant;
as you see in Mineralls, and Metalls, which indeed
at the beginning are a mucilaginous matter, and are
coagulated into Metalls, Stones, Flints, Salts, and
other bodies, by the Ætnean fire in Mountaines,
through the Archeius of Earth, and operator of
Nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What things cannot be Coagulated.</div>

<p>Also wee must know that Fire can coagulate no
water, or moisture, but only the Liquors and Juices
of all Naturall things.</p>

<p>Besides also there can no flegm bee coagulated,
unlesse in the beginning it was a corporeall matter,
into which by the industry of a skilfull Alchymist it
may return.</p>

<p>So also any mucilaginous, matter, or spermaticke
slimynesse may by the heat of Fire be coagulated into
a body and corporeall matter, but never bee resolved
into water again.</p>

<p>And as you have heard of Coagulation, so also
know concerning Solution, <i>viz.</i> that no corporeall
matter can bee dissolved into Water, unlesse at the
beginning it was water: and so it is in all Mineralls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69a" id="Page_69a"></a>[Pg 69]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What Tincture is, and its kinds.</div>

<p>Tincture is the seventh, and last degree, which
concludes the whole worke of our mystery for
Transmutation, making all imperfect things perfect,
and transmuting them into a most excellent
essence, and into a most perfect soundnesse, and
alters them into another colour.</p>

<p><i>Tincture therefore is a most excellent matter, wherewith
all Minerall, and Humane bodies are tinged,
and are changed into a better, and more noble essence,
and into the highest perfection, and purity.</i></p>

<p>For Tincture colours all things according to its
own nature, and colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All things that are to be tinged must be fluid.</div>

<p>Now there are many Tinctures, and not only
for Metalline, but Humane bodies, because every
thing which penetrates another matter, or tingeth
it with another colour, or essence, so that it
bee no more like the former, may bee called a
Tincture.</p>

<p>Wherefore there are many, and various sorts of
Tinctures, <i>viz.</i> of Metalls, Mineralls, Mens bodies,
Waters, Liquors, Oyls, Salts, all fat things, and
indeed of all things which may bee brought to flux,
out of the Fire, or in the Fire.</p>

<p>For if a Tincture must tinge, it is necessary that the
body, or matter which is to bee tinged, bee opened,
and continue in flux, and unless this should bee so,
the Tincture could not operate. But it would bee, as
if any one should cast saffron, or any colour upon coagulated
Water, or Ice: for so it would not so
suddenly tinge the Ice with its colour, as if it were
cast into other water. And although it should tinge,
yet it would at the same time resolve the Ice into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70a" id="Page_70a"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
Water. Wherefore those Metalls that wee would
tinge, must first bee melted in the Fire, and bee freed
from Coagulation.</p>

<p>And here wee must know, that by how much the
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: stonrger">stronger</span> fire is requisite for their melting, so much the
sooner the Tincture runs through them, as Leaven
penetrates, and infects the whole masse with sowreness;
and by how much better the masse is covered,
and kept warm, so much the better is it fermented,
and makes the better bread: for ferment is the Tincture
of Dowe, and Bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feces are of a more fixt nature then their Flegme.</div>

<p>Wee must also note, that all feces are of a more
fixed substance then the liquor of it is, also of a sharper,
and more penetrating nature: as you see in the
spirit of Wine which is made of the feces of Wine,
and of <i>Aqua vitæ</i>, which is distilled out of the
grounds of Beer, and burns like spirit of Wine, and
is inflamed as Sulphur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preparation, and Nature of distilled Vineger.</div>

<p>Also if of the feces of Vineger another Vineger
bee distilled, as commonly spirit of Wine is distilled,
there will bee thereby made a Vineger of so fiery,
and sharp a nature, that it consumes all Metalls,
Stones, and other things, as <i>Aqua fortis</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Tinctures of Metalls must be made.</div>

<p>Moreover, it is necessary, that Tinctures be of a
fixt, fluxil, and incombustible nature, so that
if a little of a plate of any Metall red hot bee
cast into them, they will presently flow like wax,
without any manner of fume at all, and they penetrate
the Metalls, as oyle doth paper, or water a
sponge, and tinge all Metalls into white, and red,
that is, into Silver or Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71a" id="Page_71a"></a>[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Now these are the Tinctures of Metalls, which it
is necessary must bee turned into an Alcool, by
the first degree of Calcination, then by the second
degree of Sublimation, must get an easy, and
light flux. And lastly, by the degree of Putrefaction,
and Distillation are made a fixt, and
incombustible Tincture, and of an unchangeable
colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tinctures of Men.</div>

<p>Now the Tinctures of Mens bodies are, that they
bee tinged into the highest perfection of health,
and all Diseases bee expelled from them, that
their lost strength, and colour bee restored,
and renewed, and they are these, <i>viz.</i> Gold,
Pearles, Antimony, Sulphur, Vitriall, and such like,
whose preparation wee have diversly taught in other
books; wherefore it doth not seem to us necessary
here to repeat them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Dying and Painting.</div>

<p>Wee <span class="correction" title="In the original book: shalll">shall</span> write no more of Tinctures, seeing every
extracted colour may bee called a Tincture,
which doth indeed tinge things with a permanent
colour, which doe not go into the Fire, or preserve
colours fixed in the Fire.</p>

<p>All these are in the hand, and power of the Dyer,
and Painter, who prepares them according to his
pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How many degrees of the Alchymists fire there be.</div>

<p>It is very necessary in this book to know the degrees
of Fire, which many wayes may bee graduated, and
intended, and every degree hath a peculiar operation,
and one produceth the same effect, as another,
as every expert Alchymist, by the daily experience,
and exercise of the Art knows.</p>

<p>For one is as living, and flaming Fire, which reverberates,
and Calcines all bodies: Another is the Fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72a" id="Page_72a"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
of a Candle, or Lamp, which fixeth all volatile
bodies: Another is a Fire of coals, which cements,
colours, and purgeth Metalls from their dross, exalts
Gold and Silver to a higher purity, whitens Copper,
and in brief renews all Metalls.</p>

<p>Another Fire is of an Iron plate made red hot, in
which the Tinctures of Metalls are proved, which
also is profitable for other things.</p>

<p>The Filings of Iron heat after one fashion, Sand
after another, Ashes after another, a <i>Balneum Mariæ</i>
after another, in which manifold Distillations, Sublimations,
and Coagulations are done.</p>

<p><i>Balneum roris</i> after another, in which there are
made many Solutions of corporeall things.</p>

<p>Horse-dung after another, in which the chiefest putrefactions,
and digestions are made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Celestiall fire.</div>

<p>And after another fashion works the invisible Fire,
by which wee understand the rayes of the Sun, and
that which is manifested by a glasse, or Crystall, and
shews <span class="correction" title="In the original book: it">its</span> operations and effects, of which Fire the Ancients
wrote nothing at all; and by this fire the three
Principles of every corporeall thing may bee separated.</p>

<p>This Fire is of such wonderfull force, that by it Metalls
may bee melted, and all fat, and fluxible things,
may upon the table without any Fire bee together
with all combustible things, reduced into coales, and
ashes.</p>

<p>Therefore after I have proposed, and opened
to you the degrees of the Art of Alchymie, and
the degrees of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Alchmyists">Alchymists</span> Fire: I will yet further
shew, and declare to you in generall, various
Transmutations of naturall things: of Metalls first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73a" id="Page_73a"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
secondly of Stones, and thirdly of divers things in
generall. The transmutation of Metalls therefore is
a great secret in Nature, and it can hardly bee done
by reason of many impediments, and repugnancies.
Yet it is not against Nature, nor Gods ordination, as
many falsly affirm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Transmutation of Metalls into Silver and Gold.</div>

<p>But that the five lesser, and impurer Metalls, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♃</span><span class="mobile-only">[Jupiter]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span> <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span> and <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> may be transmuted into the greater,
purest, and most perfect Metalls, <i>viz.</i> into <span class="not-mobile">☉</span><span class="mobile-only">[Sun]</span> and <span class="not-mobile">☽</span><span class="mobile-only">[Moon]</span>,
it cannot be done without the Tincture, or Philosophers
stone.</p>

<p>Now seeing we have before sufficiently opened the
secrets of Tinctures in the seven <span class="correction" title="In the original book: degres">degrees</span>, and described
them there, it is not necessary that wee spend any further
labour in this, but rather bee satisfied with those
things, which we have wrote in other books concerning
the Transmutations of Metalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Transmutation of Iron into Copper.</div>

<p>Now there are other Transmutations of imperfect,
and impure Metals, as the transmutation of <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span> into <span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span>,
which may bee done divers wayes.</p>

<p>If plates of Iron bee boiled in water of Vitriall, or
bee cemented with calcined Vitriall, or being red hot
be quenched in oyl of Vitriall.</p>

<p>These three ways Iron may be transmuted into very
good, and ponderous Copper, which indeed flows
well, and hath its weight as well as any naturall
Copper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Transmutation of Iron into Lead.</div>

<p>Plates of Iron may bee as it were reduced, and
transmuted into Lead, so that it bee as soft as naturall
Lead, but doth not flow so easily: and the processe
is this:</p>

<p>Take Filings of <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span>, and so much of the powder of
Borax, mingle them well together, put them in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74a" id="Page_74a"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
crucible, and into a wind furnace, let there bee made
a strong Fire, but so that the <span class="not-mobile">♂</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mars]</span> doe not flow, but
stand as it were in a Cement for a whole houre,
then encrease the Fire, that it may bee red hot,
and flow: then let the crucible cool of it selfe, and
thou shalt find the regulus of Lead in the bottome
of the crucible, soft, and malleable, as naturall Lead
can be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Transmutation of Copper into Lead.</div>

<p>But to transmute <span class="not-mobile">♀</span><span class="mobile-only">[Venus]</span> into <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span> the processe is this:</p>

<p>First of all bring Copper with <span class="not-mobile">☿</span><span class="mobile-only">[Mercury]</span> sublimate, and
fixt Arsenick to bee white, yea as white as <span class="not-mobile">☽</span><span class="mobile-only">[Moon]</span>, then
beat it small. Take this, and the powder of Borax, of
each a like quantity, and first cement it, then let it bee
melted into a regulus, and thou hast a true regulus
of Lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Transmutation of Lead into Copper.</div>

<p>Now on the contrary, it is easy to transmute
Lead into Copper, neither doth it require much
pains, and it is done thus:</p>

<p>Take plates of Lead, strow them over with calcined
Vitriall, or Crocus of Venus, cement them,
and then melt them, and thou shalt see naturall Lead,
transmuted into good, ponderous, and malleable
Copper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Metalline mixture like Gold.</div>

<p>Now if this Copper, or any other Copper be beaten
into plates, and strowed over with <i>Tutia</i>, or
<i>Capri Celaminaris</i>, and be cemented, and lastly melted,
it will bee transmuted into an excellent reddish
<i>Electrum</i> like to Gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To make English Tin out of Lead.</div>

<p>If thou wilt turne <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span> into <span class="not-mobile">♃</span><span class="mobile-only">[Jupiter]</span> make plates of <span class="not-mobile">♄</span><span class="mobile-only">[Saturn]</span>,
strow them with Salt Armoniack, cement, and melt
them, as abovesaid, so will all the blacknesse, and
darknesse bee taken away from the Lead, and it will
be in whitenesse like fair English Tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75a" id="Page_75a"></a>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Now as you have in briefe heard of some Mutations
of Metalls, so also know, that there are
Transmutations of Gemmes, which indeed are various,
and in no wise like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oyl of Sulphur transmutes Gemmes.</div>

<p>For you see how great Transmutations of
Gemmes there lies in oyle of Sulphur. For any Crystall
may bee tinged, and Transmuted in it,
and in time bee exalted with divers colours, as
to bee made like to the Hyacinth, Granat, or
Rubie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To Transmute the Loadstone into great strength.</div>

<p>Know also that the Loadstone may be transmuted
into a tenfold greater power, and vertue, and it is
done thus:</p>

<p>Take the Loadstone, and heat it very hot in coales,
but so that it bee not fired, which presently quench in
the Oyle of <i>Crocus Martis</i>, made of the best Carinthian
Steel, that it may imbibe as much as it
can.</p>

<p>Thou shalt by this meanes make the Loadstone
so powerfull, that thou maist pull out Nailes out
of a wall with it, and doe such like wonderfull
things with it, that the common Loadstone can
never doe.</p>

<p>Moreover, in Transmutation of Gemmes you
must know that the world is placed in two degrees of
Tincture, and Coagulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To transmute the white of an Egge into Amber
of any Colour.</div>

<p>For as the white of an Egge may bee tinged
with Saffron, and then bee coagulated into a
faire yellow Amber: with the smoke of a Pine-tree
into blacke Amber: with Verdegrease into
green, like <i>Lapis Armenius</i>: with green juice
into Amber, like the Emerald: and with the Azure
stone, into blew Amber, like a Saphir:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76a" id="Page_76a"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
with the Wood called red Wood, into red, like
a Granat, or Rubie: with a purple colour, like
to an Amethyst: with Ceruse, like to Alabaster.</p>

<p>So all Liquors, especially Metalls, and Mineralls,
may bee tinged with fixed colours, and afterwards
bee coagulated, and transmuted into Gemmes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How counterfeit Pearls are made.</div>

<p>So also may Pearles be made like true Pearles in
form, so that for splendor, and beauty they can hardly
bee discerned from the true: And they are made
thus:</p>

<p>Cleanse the white of Egges through a spunge,
as purely as may bee, then mingle with it the fairest
white Talke, or Mother of Pearle, or Mercury
coagulated with Tinne, and brought into an Alcool,
then grinde them all together on a Marble, so
that they become a thick Amalgama, which
must bee dryed in the Sunne, or behind a furnace
so long, untill it bee like Cheese, or a Liver.</p>

<p>Then of this masse make Pearles as big as
thou wilt, which hang upon the bristles of a
Hog, and being thus boared through, dry them
as Amber, and then thou hast finished them.</p>

<p>If they are not beautifull enough, anoint them
over with the white of an Egge, and dry them again,
and they will bee most goodly pearls, in form like the
naturall, but not in vertue.</p>

<p>In the like manner are Coralls made, with which
men endeavour to deceive one the other as with
Pearle. The processe is this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77a" id="Page_77a"></a>[Pg 77]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How counterfeit Coralls may be made.</div>

<p>Take Cinnabar, grinde it on a Marble, with the
white of an Egge, for the space of an houre,
then dry it, as Potters doe their Earth, then
make it into what forme thou pleasest: Afterwards
dry them as much as may bee, and noint
them over with the white of an Egge, as
thou didst Pearle, and dry them by themselves
again.</p>

<p>So thou shalt have Corall like to the naturall in
form, but not in vertue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Golden or Silver varnish.</div>

<p>Thou must also know, That the white of
an Egge may bee of it selfe coagulated into most
cleer Vernish, in the coagulation of which Silver, or
Gold may bee strewed.</p>

<p>There are also many other, and various
Transmutations of Naturall things: Whereof
those which I know, and have had experience
of, I will by the way set down, and briefly declare to
you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How wood is made a stone.</div>

<p>And first of all know, That any Wood, if it
bee put for a certaine time into the water of Salt
Gemme, is turned with much admiration into a
Stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coales of stones.</div>

<p>Also Stones in the Ætnean fire are transmuted into
Coales, which are called stony Coals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glew of skins.</div>

<p>Also Glew is boiled out of Skinnes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paper of Linnen-cloath.</div>

<p>Of Linnen cloth is made Paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silke of Flax.</div>

<p>Of Flax boiled in sharp Lie made of the Ashes of
Wood is Silke made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feathers may bee Spun.</div>

<p>Also the feathery parts pulled off from quills, and
boiled in that Lie, may bee spun, and weaved like
Cotton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78a" id="Page_78a"></a>[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Any Oyle or Spermatick mucilage may bee coagulated
into Vernish.</p>

<p>Any Liquor into Gumme, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All these are Transmutations of Naturall things,
of which Science wee have spoken enough, and there
wee shall here make an end.</p>

<i>THE EIGHTH BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Separation of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chaos the Matter of the World.</div>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_079_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>n the Creation of the world, the first separation
began from the foure Elements, seeing
the first matter of the world was one
Chaos.</p>

<p>Of this Chaos God made the greater world, being
divided into four distinct Elements, <i>viz.</i> Fire, Aire,
Water, and Earth. Fire is the hot part, Aire the moist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80a" id="Page_80a"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
Water the cold, and Earth the dry part of the greater
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What separation shall be here spoken of.</div>

<p>But that you may in brief understand the reason of
our purpose in this 8<sup>th.</sup> book, you must know, that we
doe not purpose to treat here of the Elements of all
Naturall things, seeing wee have sufficiently discoursed
of those Arcana in the Archidoxis of the separation
of Naturall things: whereby every one of them
is apart, and distinctly separated, and divided materially,
and substantially, <i>viz.</i> seeing that two, three,
or foure, or more things are mixed into one
body, and yet there is seen but one matter. Where it
often falls out, that the corporeall matter of that
thing cannot bee known by any, or signified by any
expresse name, untill there bee a separation made.
Then sometimes two, three, four, five or more things
come forth out of one matter: as is manifest
by daily experience, in the Art of Alchymie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Electrum is.</div>

<p>As for example, you have an <i>Electrum</i>, which of it
selfe is no Metall, but yet it hides all Metalls in one
Metall. That if it be anatomized by the industry of
Alchymie, and separated: all the seven Metalls, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Copper</i>, <i>Tinne</i>, <i>Lead</i>, <i>Iron</i>, and <i>Quicksilver</i>
come out of it, and that pure, and perfect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Separation is.</div>

<p>But that you may understand what Separation is,
note, that it is nothing else then the severing of one
thing from another, whether of two, three, four, or
more things mixed together: I say a separation of
the three Principles, as of Mercury, Sulphur, and
Salt, and the extraction of pure out of the impure, or
the pure, excellent spirit, and quintessence, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81a" id="Page_81a"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
grosse, and elementary body; and the preparation of
two, three, four, or more out of one: or the dissolution,
and setting at liberty things that are bound, and
compact, which are of a contrary nature, acting
one against the other, untill they destroy one the
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How many kinds of Separation.</div>

<p>Now there are many kinds of separation, many of
which are unknown to us; those, which wee have experienced
out of elementary, dissoluble naturall
things, shall in this place, according to their kinds, be
described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The separation of the Microcosme.</div>

<p>The first separation of which wee speake, must begin
from man, because hee is the Microcosme, or
little world, for whose sake the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Microcosme">Macrocosme</span> or greater
world was made, <i>viz.</i> that hee might be the separator
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body of man after death is twofold.</div>

<p>Now the separation of the Microcosme begins at
his death. For in death the two bodies of Man are separated
the one from the other, <i>viz.</i> his Celestial and
Terrestial body; <i>i.e.</i> Sacramental, and Elementary: one
of which ascends on high like an Eagle; the other falls
downward to the earth like lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the Elementary Body is.</div>

<p>The Elementary is putrefied, consumed, and
becomes a putrid stinking carkase, which being
buryed in the earth, never comes forth, or appeares
more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What a Sacramentall Body is.</div>

<p>But the Sacramentall, <i>i.e.</i> Syderiall, or Celestiall,
is never putrefied, or buried, neither doth it possesse
any place. This body appears to Men, and also
after death is seen.</p>

<p>Hence <i>Ghosts</i>, <i>Visions</i>, and <i>Supernaturall Apparitions</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whence the Cabalisticall art.</div>

<p>Hence by the ancient Magicians, the <i>Cabalisticall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82a" id="Page_82a"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
Art</i> took its beginning, of which we shall treat more
at large in the books of Cabalie.</p>

<p>After this separation is made, then after the death
of the Man three substances, <i>viz.</i> <i>Body</i>, <i>Soule</i>, and <i>Spirit</i>
are divided the one from the other, every one going
to its own place, <i>viz.</i> its own fountaine, from
whence it had its originall, <i>viz.</i> the body to the
Earth, to the first matter of the Elements: the
soul into the first matter of Sacraments, and
lastly, the spirit into the first matter of the Airy
Chaos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The separation of the Macrocosme.</div>

<p>What now hath been spoken of the separation of
the Macrocosme, the same also may bee understood
in the greater world which the great Ocean hath divided
into three parts, <span class="sidenote">Three parts of the World.</span>so that the universall world is
severed into three parts, <i>viz.</i> <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Africa</i>,
which separation is a certain representation of three
Principles, which can be separated from any Terrene,
or Elementary thing. These three Principles
are Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, of which three the
world was made, and composed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The separation of Metalls.</div>

<p>The next thing to bee known is the separation of
Metalls from their Mountains, <i>i.e.</i> the separation of
Metalls, and Mineralls.</p>

<p>By vertue of this separation many things come
forth out of one matter, as you see out of Mineralls
come forth, <i>The drosse of Metalls</i>, <i>Glasse</i>, <i>Sand</i>, <span class="correction" title="See Transcriber’s Note"><i>Piipitis</i></span>,
<i>Marcasite</i>, <i>Granatus</i>, <i>Cobaltum</i>, <i>Talke</i>, <i>Cachinna</i>,
<i>Zinetum</i>, <i>Bisemutum</i>, <i>Antimony</i>, <i>Litharge</i>, <i>Sulphur</i>,
<i>Vitriall</i>, <i>Verdegrease</i>, <i>Chrysocolla</i>, <i>the Azure Stone</i>,

and what not; what is fixt, and what not; what
wil flow, and what not; and what things are more ponderous

<h4 id="OF_THE_SEPARATION_OF_METALLS_FROM_THEIR_MINES" title="Of the Separation of Metalls from their Mines.">
<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Separation of Metalls
from their Mines.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">By fluxing powders.</div>

<p>The separation of Metalls from their Mines is
done divers ways, <i>viz.</i> by boiling, and melting
with fluxing powders, such as are salt Alcali, Litharge,
salt fluxile, the drosse of Glasse, Salt Gemme, Salt
Petre, &amp;c. Let them bee put in a Crucible, and
melted in a furnace; so will the Metall, or regulus
fall to the bottome of the Crucible; but the other
matter will swim above, and become drosse. Thou
shall boil this Metalline <i>regulus</i> in a reverberating
furnace so long, till all the Metall become pure, and
freed from all its drosse; by this means the metall is
well digested, and as I may say refined from all its
drosse.</p>

<p>Many times one mine contains more then one Metall,
as Copper and Silver, Copper and Gold, Lead
and Silver, Tinne and Silver, you shall know it by
this, if the Metalline Regulus after Reverberation in
a melting pot bee sufficiently after the true manner
dissolved. For in it are all imperfect Metalls separated,
as are Iron, Copper, Tin, and Lead, and so with
a double quantity of Lead to the Regulus being put
to it, they all goe into a fume, and only fine Silver, or
Gold are left behind in the pot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By Aqua fortis.</div>

<p>Also two or three Metalls mixed together may bee
separated in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and extracted the one from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86a" id="Page_86a"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
the other. If two Metalls or one bee resolved, the
other will fall to the bottome like sand, and be precipitated:
and be after this manner separated. Also
Metalls may be separated by flowing after this process:
<span class="sidenote">By Sulphur.</span>Make metals flow, and when they are in flux, cast
into them the best flower of Sulphur as you can get,
<i>viz.</i> an ounce to every pound of the metall, and let it
burn, and by that means it wil draw up the lightest
metall to the top, the heavy falling to the bottome.
Then let them stand together till they be cold.
<span class="sidenote">A wonderfull power of Sulphur in separation.</span>
And so in one Regulus two metalls are found, not as before
mutually mixed, but one separated from the
other by the Sulphur, as by a partition, as Oyle
divides two Waters, that they cannot bee joined
together or mixed: Sulphur therefore is a singular
Arcanum worthy of great commendations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By Quicksilver.</div>

<p>Fixt metalls, as Gold and Silver, because they cannot
wel bee extracted with Fire or <i>Aqua fortis</i>, must
bee amalgamated with Quicksilver, and so separated
and extracted, the Quicksilver being afterwards extracted
and separated by a certaine degree of Distillation
from the Calx of the metals, <i>viz.</i> Gold, &amp; Silver.</p>

<p>After this manner also may other metalls, not only
Gold, and Silver, but Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead, &amp;c.
as also whatsoever are prepared out of them, as red
Electrum, the white Magnesia, Aurichalcum, calcined
Lead, Laton, Brasse of Cauldrons, and whatsoever
metalls of this kind are transmuted, bee with
Quicksilver, but first being powdered, abstracted, and
separated from what is heterogeneous. For the nature,
and condition of Quicksilver is this, that it wil
bee united, and amalgamed with metalls, but yet
with one sooner then with another, according as the
metall is of greater or lesse affinity to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87a" id="Page_87a"></a>[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>In this consideration fine Gold is the chiefest, then
fine Silver, then Lead, then Tinne, then Copper, and
lastly Iron.</p>

<p>So amongst transmuted metalls, the first is part
with part, then Ash coloured Lead, then Laton, then
Brasse of Caldrons, then red, and the newest white.
Although for the first course Mercury may take no
more then one metall, with which it is amalgamated:
yet that Amalgama is to be strained hard through
Leather, or Cotton cloath. For by this means nothing
but the Quicksilver will passe through the
Leather, or Cloath: and that metall which it
did attract remains in the leather, or cloth like Calx,
which afterwards thou maist with salt Alcali, or some
other salt reduce into a metalline body by melting.</p>

<p>Now by this Art Quicksilver is much sooner separated
from all manner of metalls, then by Distillation,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>By this processe with Mercury all metalls may
after calcination, and powdering be by a skilfull, and
industrious Alchymist extracted, and separated one
from the other.</p>

<p>In the same manner, and that easily, may Tinne,
and Lead bee separated from Copper, or Copper
vessels, from Iron, and Steel overlaid with Tin without
any fire, or water, by the Amalgama of Quicksilver
alone.</p>

<p>Also Beaten Gold, or Leafe Gold, or Silver, as
also any other metall beaten, or ground, being
written, or laid over with a pencill, or quill upon
cloth, parchment, paper, leather, wood, stones, or
any thing else, may bee resolved by Quicksilver, and
so, that the Quicksilver may bee afterward separated
again from those metalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88a" id="Page_88a"></a>[Pg 88]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">By Corrosive waters.</div>

<p>Now the separation of metalls in <i>Aqua fortis</i>,
<i>Aqua Regis</i>, and like corrosive waters, is after this
manner.</p>

<p>Let a metall that is mixed, and joined with another,
be taken, and beaten <span class="correction" title="In the original book: intto">into</span> thin plates, or brought into
powder. Put it into a separating vessel, and poure
upon it common <i>Aqua fortis</i> as much as is sufficient, let
them stand and bee macerated, until all the metall bee
resolved into a clear water. If it be Silver, and contain
any Gold in it, all the Silver wil bee resolved into
water, and the Gold wil also bee calcined, and settle
in the bottome like black sand. And after this manner
Gold, and Silver are separated. If now thou wilt
separate the Silver from the <i>Aqua fortis</i> without
Distillation, put a plate of Copper into the water,
and the Silver will presently settle in the bottome of
the water like snow, and the Copper plate will begin
to be consumed by little, and little.</p>

<p>The seperation of Silver, and Copper by common
<i>Aqua fortis</i> is done after this manner. Let the Copper
which contains Silver, or the Silver which contains
Copper be brought to thin plates or powder, and put
into a glass vessel, upon which poure as much common
<i>Aqua fortis</i> as is sufficient: and by this means the silver
will bee calcined, and settle to the bottome like white
chalk: but the copper wil be dissolved, and turned into
a clear water. If this water, together with the dissolved
copper, be by a Glasse funnel separated from the silver
calx into another Glasse: then the Copper that is dissolved
in the water, may bee so <span class="correction" title="In the original book: precipiated">precipitated</span> with
common water, or rain water, or any other water,
that it wil settle to the bottom of the Glass like sand.</p>

<p>Now the separation of hid Gold, from any metall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89a" id="Page_89a"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
is by the degree of Extraction in <i>Aqua Regis</i>. For
this kind of water will attempt to dissolve no metall,
but only pure, fine Gold, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The same <i>Aqua Regis</i> doth separate also fine gold
from gilded plate. For if that be washed over with it,
the Gold will be separated from it, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By the degree of Reverberation.</div>

<p>Moreover also with cement by the degree of Reverberation
two Metalls mixed together may be separated
the one from the other, but especially if they
are not in the like degree of Fixation, as Iron and
Copper. For that Metall, which is but little fixed, as
Tin, and Lead, is all of it consumed by the degree of
Reverberation in cement. For by how much the more
a Metall is fixed, so much the lesse is it consumed by
cement.</p>

<p>You must know therefore that fine Gold is the
most fixt, and perfect Metall, which can bee destroyed,
or consumed by no cement. Next to this is fine
Silver. If then Gold, and Silver be mixed together
in one body, which is wont to bee called part with
part, or if Silver contain Gold, or Gold Silver: I say
these being thus mixt if they bee reverberated into cement,
then the Gold remains entire, and not at all injured,
but the Silver is consumed by the cement, and
so is extracted from fine Gold: so also is Copper from
Silver, and Iron, and Tinne from Copper, and Iron,
or Lead from Tinne, and so forth.</p>

</span><br />
<i>Of the Separation of Mineralls.</i></h4>

<p>After that wee have explained (as hitherto wee
have done) the separation of Metalls from their
Earth, and matter, as also of one Metall from another,
and how it is done having passed through it with
as much brevity as might be: it will in the next place
bee necessary that wee treat also of those things out
of which Metalls grow, and are generated, as are the
three Principles. Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, as also
all Mineralls, in which the first being of Metalls,
<i>i.e.</i> the spirit of Metalls is found, as is manifest in
Marcasites, Granats, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Cachymiies">Cachymies</span>, red Talke, the
Azure stone, and the like, in which the first being of
Gold is found by the degree of Sublimation. So in
white Marcasite, white Talke, Auripigmentum, Arsenick,
Litharge, &amp;c. the first being of Silver is found: In
Cobaltus, Zinetus, &amp;c. the first being of Iron: In Zinetus,
Vitriall, Verdegrease, &amp;c. the first being of Copper:
In Zinetus, Bisemutus, &amp;c. the first being of Tin:
In Antimony, Minium, &amp;c. the first being of Lead:
In Cinnabar, the first being of Quicksilver is
found.</p>

<p>Concerning this first beginning you must know,
that it is a volatile spirit, as yet consisting in volatility,
as an infant lies in the wombe of its Mother, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91a" id="Page_91a"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
sometimes is made like to Liquor, sometimes to Alcool.</p>

<p>Whosoever therefore desires to busie himselfe
about the getting of the first being of any such body,
or to separate it, must of necessity have much experience,
and knowledge in the Art of Alchymie.</p>

<p>For if hee shall not diligently and skilfully work in
Alchymie, hee shal attempt many things in vain, and
accomplish nothing.</p>

<p>But after what manner the first being is to be separated
out of any Minerall, is sufficiently explained in
the booke called <i>Archidoxis</i>, and need not here tediously
bee repeated.</p>

<p>But as concerning the separation of Mineralls, you
must note, that many of them are to bee separated
by the degree of Sublimation as fixed from those
which are not fixed, spirituall and volatile bodies
from fixt bodies, and so accordingly of all the members,
as is declared concerning Metalls. For of all
Mineralls there is one, and the like processe through
all degrees, as the Art of Alchymie teacheth, &amp;c.</p>

<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Separation of Vegetables.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">How Vegetables
are separated.</div>

<p>The separation of those things, which grow out
of the Earth, and are combustible, as fruits,
hearbs, flowers, leaves, grasse, roots, woods, &amp;c. is
made many wayes.</p>

<p>For first by Distillation the Flegm is separated from
them, then the Mercury, then the Oyle, then the Refine,
then the Sulphur, and lastly the Salt.</p>

<p>All these Separations being made according to the
Spagiricall Art many notable, and excellent medicines
come from thence, which are to be used as well
within, as without the body.</p>

<p>But now seeing idlenesse is so much in request amongst
Physitians, and all labour and study is turned
only to insolency; truly I do not wonder, that all such
preparations are every where neglected, and coales
sold at so low a price, that if Smiths could be so easily
without coales in forging, and working their Metalls,
as Physitians are in preparing their Medicines, certainly
Colliers would long since have been brought
to extream want.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A reprehension of Physitians.</div>

<p>In the mean time I will give to Spagiricall Physitians
their due praise. For they are not given to idlenesse,
and sloth, nor goe in a proud habit, or plush and
velvet garments, often shewing their rings upon their
fingers, or wearing swords with silver hilts by their
sides, or fine and gay gloves upon their hands, but diligently
follow their labours, sweating whole
nights, and dayes by their furnaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93a" id="Page_93a"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
<span class="sidenote">The commendation of Chymists, and how
they differ from other Physitians.</span>These doe not spend their time abroad for recreation,
but take delight in their laboratory. They wear
Leather garments with a pouch, and Apron wherewith
they wipe their hands. They put their fingers
amongst coales, into clay, and dung, not into gold
rings. They are sooty, and black, like Smithes, or
Colliers, and doe not pride themselves with cleane,
and beautifull faces. They are not talkative when
they come to the sick, neither doe they extoll their
Medicines: seeing they well know that the Artificer
must not commend his work, but the work the
Artificer, and that the sick cannot be cured with fine
words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How many degrees of Alchymie there be.</div>

<p>Therefore laying aside all these kinds of vanities,
they delight to bee busied about the fire, and to learn
the degrees of the science of Alchymie: Of this order
are <i>Distillation</i>, <i>Resolution</i>, <i>Putrefaction</i>, <i>Extraction</i>,
<i>Calcination</i>, <i>Reverberation</i>, <i>Sublimation</i>, <i>Fixation</i>,
<i>Separation</i>, <i>Reduction</i>, <i>Coagulation</i>, <i>Tincture</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But how these separations may bee done by the
help of distinct degrees according to the Art of
Alchymie, hath been in generall spoken of already.
Wherefore it is needlesse here to make repetition.</p>

<p>But to proceed to particulars, and briefly to explaine
the practise, you must know that <i>Water</i>,
<i>Spirit</i>, <i>Liquor</i>, <i>Oyle</i>, &amp;c. cannot bee separated
after one and the same processe, out of Flowers,
Hearbes, Seeds, Leaves, Roots, Trees, Fruits, Woods,
by the degree of Distillation.</p>

<p>For Hearbs require one processe, Flowers another,
Seeds another, Leaves another, Roots another, Trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94a" id="Page_94a"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
another, the Stalkes another, the Fruite another,
Woods another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The degrees of fire in Distillation.</div>

<p>And in this degree of Distillation, there are
also foure distinct degrees of Fire to bee considered.</p>

<p>The first degree of Fire in Distillation is <i>Balneum
Mariæ</i>, this Distillation is made in Water.</p>

<p>Another degree of Fire is Distillation made in
Ashes.</p>

<p>The third in Sand.</p>

<p>The fourth in a naked Fire: as also Distillation
may bee made by <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and other sharp
Waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With what degrees of fire every Vegetable is to be Distilled.</div>

<p>To the first degree of Fire belong, Hearbs, Flowers,
Seeds, and such like.</p>

<p>To the second, Leaves, Fruits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To the third, Roots, and Boughes of trees, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To the fourth, Wood, and such like.</p>

<p>Note, that every one of these must bee beaten
small, and bruised before they bee put into the
Still.</p>

<p>And thus much bee spoken concerning the Distillation
of Waters out of the Vegetable substances.</p>

<p>As concerning the Seperation and Distillation of
Oyls, the processe is the same as that of Water, only
some of them are to bee distilled <i>per descensum</i>, and
cannot ascend as Waters, the processe of these in this
case is to bee changed.</p>

<p>But Liquors are not separated in Distillation as
Waters, or Oyles, but are expressed from their corporeall
substances with a presse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95a" id="Page_95a"></a>[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>And here wee must know, that there are some
Oyles that are pressed out, and separated after the
same manner, by a Presse as liquors are, and that
for this reason, because they should not contract
an ill odour from the Fire, as otherwise they would
doe.</p>

<p>Of this Order is the Oyle of Almonds, Nuts, hard
egges, and the like.</p>

<p>Also wee must note, that all Oyles, if they be prepared,
and coagulated according to the Spagiricall
Art, yeeld a kind of Vernish, Gumme, Amber, or
Resine, which may bee also called Sulphur, and
that which remaines in the bottome of the Still
may bee calcined, and brought to ashes, and
from it may bee with warme water alone, the
Alcali extracted, and separated from it.</p>

<p>The Ashes which is left behind is called the Dead
Earth, out of which never any else can bee extracted.</p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_SEPARATION_OF_ANIMALLS" title="Of the Separation of Animalls.">
<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Separation of Animalls.</i></h4>

<p>It is necessary, that Anatomie goe before the
separation of Animalls, that the bloud may bee
apart, the flesh apart, the bones apart, the skinne
apart, the bowels apart, the tendons apart, &amp;c. and
after this must every one of these bee separated by it
selfe by the help of the Spagiricall Art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96a" id="Page_96a"></a>[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Therefore the separations in this place are chiefly 4.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foure degrees of the separation of Animalls.</div>

<p>The first draws forth a waterie, and flegmatick humidity
from the bloud. For from the bloud being
after this manner, according to the processe shewed
in the book of Conservations, <span class="sidenote">Mummie, &amp;c.</span>prepared, there comes
forth a most excellent Mummie, and so excellent a
<i>Specificum</i>, that any fresh wound may bee cured, and
consolidated in the space of twenty four hours, only
with one binding up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balsome, &amp;c.</div>

<p>The second is the separation of fat from flesh;
for that being separated from Mans flesh is a most
excellent balsome allaying the pains of the Gout,
and Cramp, and such like pains, if any part affected
bee anointed with it warm. It helps also the tendons
of the hands, or feet, being drawn together, if they
bee daily anointed with it. It cures also the scab, and
all kinds of Leprosy.</p>

<p>Therefore it is the chiefest Chirurgical specificum,
and in all cases, as in wounds and the like most profitable,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The third is the separation of waterie, and flegmatick
moisture, together with the fat extracted out
of bones. For if these two bee carefully by the Art
of Alchymie separated from Mens bones by the degree
of Distillation, and the bones bee reduced, or
burnt into most white ashes by the degree of Calcination;
and then these three bee again after a right
manner joined together, so that they resemble butter,
they become a most wonderfull specificall <i>Arcanum</i>,
with which thou maist soundly cure any fracture of
bones without any pain at three bindings up, so
that thou dost handle, and set the fracture according
to the rules of Chirurgery, and then apply
that specificum by way of plaister, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97a" id="Page_97a"></a>[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>This also doth most speedily cure the wounds of
the skull, and any other contusion of bones whatsoever.</p>

<p>The fourth, and the last is the separation of Resines,
and Gummes from the Skin, Bowels, and tendons.
For this Resine being extracted, and separated out
of them by the degree of Extraction, according to
the Spagiricall Art, and coagulated by the beams of
the Sun, become a cleer transparent Glew. Out of
this glew being prepared, extracted and separated out
of Mans body, as is prescribed, a most excellent <i>Arcanum</i>,
and specificall stiptick comes forth, wherewith
Wounds, and Ulcers may speedily bee consolidated,
and their lips bee brought together: (even
as two boards are glewed together with glew put betwixt
them) so that you put two or three drops of it
being resolved into the wound. This also is a singular
<i>Arcanum</i> for Burns, Falling of the nails, Scabs, &amp;c.
if the place affected bee nointed with it. For the skin
will presently bee brought over the raw flesh.</p>

<p>There might many other separations of these and
other things bee reckoned up. But seeing wee have
mentioned them in other places, it would bee but lost
labour here to repeat them. It wil bee necessary that
wee speak of those things here, of which wee have
made no mention elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The last Separation is the last Iudgment.</div>

<p>And lastly in the end of all things shall bee
the last separation, in the third generation, the
great day when the Son of God shall come in majesty,
and glory, <span class="sidenote">The Manner of the last Iudgement.</span>before whom shall be carried not swords,
garlands, diadems, scepters, &amp;c. and Kingly jewels,
with which Princes, Kings, Cesars, &amp;c. doe pompously
set forth themselves, but his Crosse, his crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98a" id="Page_98a"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
of thorns, and nails thrust through his hands, and
feet, and spear with which his side was pierced, and
the reed, and spunge in which they gave him vineger
to drinke, and the whips wherewith hee was scourged,
and beaten. He comes not accompanyed with
troopes of Horse, and beating of Drums, but foure
Trumpets shall bee sounded by the Angells towards
the foure parts of the world, killing all that are then
alive with their horrible noise, in one moment, and
then presently raising these again, together with them
that are dead, and buryed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Matth. 25.</div>

<p>For the voice shall bee heard: <i>Arise yee dead,
and come to judgment.</i> Then shal the twelve Apostles
sit down, their seats being prepared in the clouds, and
shal judge the twelve Tribes of <i>Israel</i>. In that place
the holy Angels shall separate the bad from the good,
the cursed from the blessed, the goats from the sheep.
Then the cursed shall like stones, and lead be thrown
downward: but the blessed shall like eagles fly on
high. Then from the tribunall of God shal go forth
this voice to them that stand on his left hand: <i>Goe yee
Cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devill,
and his Angells from all eternity: For I was an hungry,
and yee fed me not; thirsty, and you gave no drink;
sick, in prison, and naked, and you visited me not, freed
mee not, cloathed me not, and you shewed no pity towards
me, therefore shalt you expect no pity from me.</i>
On the contrary, hee shal speak to them on his right
hand: <i>Come yee blessed; and chosen into my Fathers
Kingdome, which hath been prepared for you, and his
Angells from the foundation of the world. For I was
hungry, and you gave me meat; thirsty, and you gave
me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in; naked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99a" id="Page_99a"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
and you covered me; sick, and you visited me; in prison,
and you came unto me. Therefore I will receive you into
my Fathers Kingdom, where are provided many mansions
for the Saints. You took pity on me, therefore will
I take pity on you.</i></p>

<p>All these being finished, and dispatched, all Elementary
things wil returne to the first matter of the
Elements, and bee tormented to eternity, and never
bee consumed, &amp;c. and on the contrary, all holy
things shall return to the first matter of Sacraments:
<i>i.e.</i> shall be purified, and in eternall joy glorifie God
their Creator, and worship him from age to age, from
eternity, to eternity, Amen.</p>

<i>THE NINTH BOOK.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Signature of Naturall
things.</i></p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap" src="images/c_100_i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="I" /></div>

<p>n this Booke it is convenient for us speaking
of the Signature of things in the first
place, to declare by whom things are signed,
and who the Signator is, and how many
things there be that are signed. You must therefore
know, that things that are signed are of 3 sorts. The
first sort of them Man signs: the second, the Archeius:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101a" id="Page_101a"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
the third, the stars of supernaturall things. Therefore
upon this account there are three Signators: Man,
the Archeius, and Stars.</p>

<p>Moreover, you must note, that impressions signed
by men do bring with them a perfect knowledge, and
judgement of hid things, and impart the knowledg of
their hid vertues, and faculties.</p>

<p>The markes of the Stars cause Prophecies, and Presages,
and declare the supernaturall vertues of things,
and take out the true judgements, and signes, in Geomancy,
Chiromancy, Physiognomy, Hydromancy,
Pyromancy, Necromancy, Astronomy, the Berillisticall
art, and other Astrall sciences.</p>

<p>But that wee may explain briefly, and truly all the
signes, or markes, it wil be necessary in the first place,
that wee speak of those signes of which Man is the
Signer. Those being understood; you may the more
rightly understand the rest, whether naturall, or supernaturall.
It is therefore known, that the <i>Iews</i> carry
about them, upon their cloak, or coat a yellow sign.
And this is nothing else but that mark, by which they
would have you, when you meet them, to know
that they are <i>Iews</i>. So a Serjeant is known by
his divers coloured coat, or sleeve. So every <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Magigrate">Magistrate</span>
apparells his servants with his own colours, and
liveries.</p>

<p>Every Mechanick marks his work with a certaine
signe, that every one may know whose work it is.</p>

<p>For which end Carriers wear the liverie of their
master, or city, that it may be known whom they serve
and from whence they travell, that thereby they may
goe the safer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102a" id="Page_102a"></a>[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>So every Souldier wears a marke, or badge, as colours,
black, white, yellow, green, blew, or red, &amp;c.
that he may be distinguished from the enemie. Hence
it may bee known that this is <i>Cesars</i> souldier, that the
<i>Kings</i>, this an <i>Italian</i>, this a <i>French</i> souldier, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These are signes which belong to order, or office, of
which many more may bee reckoned up. But yet
because wee have intended to describe the signes of
naturall, and supernaturall things, wee shal not fill up
this booke with other signes.</p>

<p>As concerning those signes, which Man makes,
which doe not only respect order, office, or name, but
conduce to the knowing of his knowledge, age, dignity,
degree, &amp;c. You must know concerning Money,
that every kind thereof hath its peculiar triall, and
marke, by which it is known, how much it is valued
at, who is the Master of it, and in what place it is
usually currant. Hence is that <i>German</i> Proverb, Money
is no where more in request then where it was coined.</p>

<p>The same also is to bee understood of things that
are looked upon and examined by men sworn and
appointed for that purpose, before they bee signed:
as Cloth which is marked with peculiar marks, by
which it may be known, that in examining they were
found good, and proved. Why is a seal put upon
Letters, but that there is a certain bond, which it is
lawfull for no man to violate? For a seal is a confirmation
of Letters, whence they are of all men accounted
ratified. Without a seale an Acquitance is
void, and of no force.</p>

<p>After the same manner many things are marked
with few letters, names, or words, as books, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103a" id="Page_103a"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
being writ upon the outside but with one word, doe
presently shew what is contained within.</p>

<p>The same rule also there is for glasses and boxes in
Apothecaries shops, all which are discerned by peculiar
names, or papers put upon them. Unlesse that
were done, who could discern so many Waters, Liquors,
Syrups, Oyles, Powders, Seeds, Unguents, &amp;c.
and all simples? After the same manner doth the
Alchymist in his Elabatorie mark with names, and
papers all Waters, Liquors, Spirits, Oyles, Flegms,
Crocus, Alcali, and all species, that thereby hee may
when there is occasion make use of any of them, and
know them: without the help of which his memory
could never bear them.</p>

<p>So also may all houses and buildings bee marked
with numbers or figures, that the age of every one of
them by the first sight of the number may presently
be known.</p>

<p>These and other things that are marked I was willing
to shew to you, that these being comprehended, I
might bee the better understood by you in the rest,
and so the signification of every thing might bee the
more plain, and clear.</p>

<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Monstrous Signes of Men.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Divers monstrous signes or Markes.</div>

<p>Many men are brought forth deformed with
monstrous marks, or signes: so one abounds
with one finger, or Toe, another wants one. The fingers
of some grow all together in the mothers womb.
Another hath a wry foot, arm, or neck, &amp;c. and brings
it with him out of the womb. Another hath a bunch
in his back: so also, are Hermaphrodites born, <i>i.e.</i>
they which are both Male, and Female, and have the
members both of Man, and Woman, or else want
both. I have observed many of these monstrous signs,
as well in Males, as in Females, all which are to bee
accounted for monstrous signes of secret evil ascendents.
<span class="sidenote">What monstrous signes shew.</span>Whence that proverb is made good; The more
crooked, the more wicked: Lame members, lame
deeds. For they are signes of vices, seldome signifying
any good.</p>

<p>As the Executioner marks his sons with infamous
markes: so the evil Ascendents impresse upon their
yong, supernatural mischievous marks, that they may
bee the better taken heed of, which shew some marks
in their forehead, cheeks, ears, fingers, hands, eyes,
tongues, &amp;c. being short, or cutted. Every one of these
infamous signes denotes a peculiar vice. So a mark
burnt upon the face of a Woman, or the cutting off
her ears, for the most part signifies theft: the cutting
off the fingers, cheating Dicers: the cutting off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105a" id="Page_105a"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
hand, breakers of the peace: the cutting off two of the
fingers perjured: the pulling out of the eye, cunning,
and subtile villains: the cutting out of the tongue,
blasphemers, slanderers, &amp;c. So also you may know
them that deny the Christian Religion by a crosse
burnt in the soles of their feet, because <i>viz.</i> they have
denyed their Redeemer.</p>

<p>But that passing by these we may proceed to the monstrous
signs of Malignants ascending, you must know,
that all monstrous signes do not arise from an Ascendent
only, but oftentimes also from the stars of Mens
minds, which continually and every moment ascend,
and descend with the fancy, estimation, or imagination,
no otherwise then in the superiour firmament.
Hence either from fear, or terrour of breeding; Women,
many monsters, or children marked with monstrous
signes in the womb, are borne. The primary
cause of these is fear, terror, appetite from which is
raised the imagination. If a woman with child begin
to imagine, then her heaven by its motion is carryed
round, no otherwise then the superiour firmament
every moment, with Ascendents, or risings, or Settings.
For according to the example of the greater
firmament, the stars of the Microcosme also are
moved by Imagination, untill there be an assault,
whereby the stars of the Imagination convey an
influence, and impression upon the Woman that is
breeding, just as if anyone should impresse a seale,
or stamp money. Whence these signes, and geniall
marks are called Impressions of inferiour stars, of
which many Philosophers have wrote many things,
and men have endeavoured much to give a full, and
rationall account of, which could never yet bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106a" id="Page_106a"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
done. Yet they doe adhere, and are impressed on the
infants, as the stars of the Mother, whether frequent
or violent, doe rest upon the Infants, or the Mothers
longing is not satisfied: For if the Mother long for
this, or that meat, and cannot have it, the starres are
suffocated as it were in themselves, and dye: And
that longing doth follow the infant all its life time,
that it can never bee well satisfied. The like reason is
there of other things, of which we shall not hear Discourse
any further.</p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_ASTRALL_SIGNES_OF_PHYSIOGNOMY_IN_MAN" title="Of the Astrall Signes of Physiognomy in Man.">
<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Astrall Signes of Physiognomy in Man.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The Originall of Physiognomie.</div>

<p>The signes of Physiognomy receive their original
from the superior stars; this art of Physiognomy
was greatly esteemed of by our Ancestors, and especially
by Heathens, Tartars, and Turks, &amp;c. and other
people, amongst whom it was the custome to sel men
for slaves, and it is not yet altogether laid aside amongst
Christians. Yet together with it many errors
crept in, not yet taken notice of by any, whilest every
blockish ignorant fellow would take upon him without
any manner of judgement to judge of any one.
Where it is worthy of admiration that those erours
should never bee taken notice of from the workes,
deeds, and abilities of the men.</p>

<p>Now if any one shall in this place argue against us,
saying, that the signes of Physiognomy are from the
stars, and that the stars have no power to compell any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107a" id="Page_107a"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
one or stir him up; he indeed doth not speak amisse: but
yet there is some difference in it which must be taken
notice of, because the stars compell some, and others
they doe not compell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man is the Lord of all other Creatures.</div>

<p>For here we must know, who can rule or constrain
the stars, and who can be governed by them.
Therefore for this you must note, that a wise man
can rule the stars, and not be subject to them. The
stars are subject to a wise man, and are forced to obey
him, and not he the stars. But the stars compell an
Animall man, that whither they lead him hee must
follow, just as a thief doth the gallows, and a high-way
robber the wheel, the fisher the fishes, the fowler
the birds, the hunter the wild beasts. And what
here is the cause of this, but that such a kind of
man doth neither know himself, nor his own strength,
never considers, or thinks that he is the lesser world,
and that he hath the universall Firmament with the
powers thereof hid in him? Wherefore he is called
an Animall, an ignorant man, and a slave to any base
service, and all earthly matters; yet whereas he
received that priviledge from God in Paradise, that
hee should rule, and reign over all other creatures of
the Universe, and should not bee obedient to them;
therefore God created him last of all, all the rest being
made before him. This priviledg man afterwards
lost by his fall: but yet the wisdome of man was
not made servile, nor did hee let that liberty goe out
of his hands. Whence it is requisite that the starres
should follow him, and obey him, and not he the stars.
And although hee indeed be the son of Saturne, and
Saturn his Ascendent; yet hee can remove himselfe
from him, and so overcome him, that he can be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108a" id="Page_108a"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
off-spring of the Sun;<span class="sidenote">How a man may withdrawe him selfe from
one star, and bring him selfe under another.</span>and bring himselfe under any
other planet, and make himselfe its Son. And it is
the same case here as with a Digger, who for a time
hath spent his pains with the Master of the Mines,
and with the hazard of his life hath performed his service
faithfully, at length reasons, and discourseth with
himselfe thus.</p>

<p>What will become of thee at last, if thou spendest
all thy life under the earth, and by thy continuall labours
dost also bring thy body, and life into danger?
I will get a release from my Master, and I will serve
another Master, where my life may be made sweeter,
where I may have plenty of meat, and drink, where I
may wear better clothes, have little work and much
wages, where there shall bee no danger of the mountain
hanging over mee, and ready to fall upon me, &amp;c.
After this manner hee would bee at liberty, when as
otherwise hee must remaine a Mercenary servant,
and slave, pining away with much labour, and low
feeding, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now you see how a wise man commands the stars,
and can remove himselfe from any malignant planet,
and bring himselfe under another better, how he can
bring himselfe out of slavery into liberty, and can free
himselfe out of the prison of an ill planet.</p>

<p>So also an Animall man, who <i>i</i>s the son of the Sun,
of <i>Iupiter</i>, <i>Venus</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>, may remove himself
from a benigne planet, and subject himself to <i>Saturne</i>,
or <i>Mars</i>: such a man is like to a man, who runs from
a religious Colledge, and being impatient of an easy
life becomes a Souldier, or else a man of no repute,
who afterwards spends all his life in sorrow, and misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109a" id="Page_109a"></a>[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Such an one also is a rich man, who being given to
levity, spends, and wasts all his goods, in Dicing,
Feasting, Whoring, &amp;c. which hee gives himselfe to
so long untill all bee spent, then hee comes to want,
and being miserably afflicted with infamous want,
becomes deservedly a laughter and scorn to all men,
yea even to the very boyes in the streets, whom you
may hear saying: Behold a beggerly man worth
nothing, who when hee was a Master disdained his
Mastership, and had rather be a slave, a begger, a slave
to servants; seeing he can never come to his priviledg
again.</p>

<p>And hither doth a Malignant star, or Ascendent
drive him. Unlesse he had been a foole, and dishonest,
he had not left so certain a Dominion, which hee
had over the stars, but had strove against it: And
although of himselfe hee knew not how to resist the
stars; yet hee might have bent his mind to the examples
of others; thinking thus with himselfe: See how
rich that man was, but foolishly, and shamefully hath
brought himself to poverty. Also he lived gallantly,
without much labour, had so much meat, such wages,
that he could not live better. Now he lives sparingly,
and sordidly, and in stead of Wine hee <span class="correction" title="In the original book: mnst">must</span> drinke
Water, his labours daily increase, his wages decrease.</p>

<p>Now how often doth such a kind of Man talke
after this manner with himselfe. What have I
done? Whither am I running headlong, so basely
spending my goods that I got, who will repaire
my estate? If ever I shall receive what hath been
thus spent, I will take a far other course of life,
and will by my harms learne to bee wise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110a" id="Page_110a"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
will make amends for my evill deeds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No man is wise by his own harmes, but by anothers.</div>

<p>But it is convenient to know, that no man can
bee wise by his owne harme. For it is a foolish,
and senselesse thing to bee wise by ones owne
harme. Let him that will be wise, be wise by
another mans example, not by his owne. For
hee that hath once spent his estate, would spend
it againe if hee should have it, and he that once
perisheth, perisheth for ever. Hee which once
hath cast a Dice, casts it again. Hee which once
stole, and escaped the gallowes, will endeavour
to steal the second time also. For hee thinkes
thus with himselfe. My enterprizes have succeeded
once, and again, and why not the third, or
fourth time? If God should once restore what I
have lost, hee would restore it the second, and third
time, &amp;c. If hee did not forsake mee in my
first misery, hee will not in the second, or
third, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All these doth an Animall man doe, the servant,
and slave of the stars, who is turned every
where, and moved by the stars, as a Reed in
water.</p>

<p>And this is the reason why his life is spent in misery,
and he dies in infamy.</p>

<p>Who therefore will sustain such servitude, and
not deliver himselfe from such a nasty prison? For
any one may by his owne wisdome, together
with the help of his star, deliver, and free himselfe
from thence. Consider the matter thus:</p>

<p>A Fowler by his prudence, and help of his
star, overcoming another starre, needs not goe
after birds, for they will come after him fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111a" id="Page_111a"></a>[Pg 111]</span>ing
to unusuall places, contrary to their nature.</p>

<p>So a Fisherman can by making use of the wisdome
which God hath given him make fishes swim
to him of their own accord, so that he may take
them up with his hands.</p>

<p>A Hunter improving his wisdome, doth by his
star so compell the wild beasts, that hee need not
follow them, but they will follow him without
any impulse of nature. So also of the rest of living
creatures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stars are twofold.</div>

<p>Now for the better understanding of these things,
you must know, that Stars are twofold; terrestriall,
and celestiall, these of wisdome, the other of
folly.</p>

<p>And as there are two worlds, the greater, and the
lesser, and the greater governs the lesser: so also
the starres of the Microcosme doe rule, and overcome
the celestiall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The end of the Starrs is to serve, not
command man.</div>

<p>Neither did God create the planets, and other
stars of the heaven, that they should rule over man,
but that they, as all other creatures, should obey,
and serve him. And although the superiour stars
doe incline men, and signe them as also all other
terrestiall bodies, with naturall signes, according to
the manner of their generation; yet that is no power,
or soveraignty, but only a predestinated command,
and office, whereby nothing may remaine
hid, or concealed, but the inward force,
and power may bee brought forth by exteriour
signes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signes are twofold.</div>

<p>But to return to our purpose of the Physiognomicall
signes of Men, you must know, that they are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112a" id="Page_112a"></a>[Pg 112]</span>fold,
in externall shape indeed alike, but in power, and
effect unlike.</p>

<p>Some are from supernaturall stars of the heaven,
the other, from the inferiour starres, <i>viz.</i> of the Microcosme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Physignomicall">Physiognomicall</span> signes.</div>

<p>Whatsoever the superiour star signes according to
generation, even to the midle age, that thing signed
is predestinated, not wanting peculiar powers.
For it doth testifie of the nature, and condition
of Man. Whatsoever therefore the inferiour star of
the Microcosme doth sign in generation, hath its
originall from the Father, and Mother, <i>viz.</i> as oft as
the Mother by her imagination, or appetite, feare, or
terror hath by contact affected her infant in her
womb with supernaturall signes, which are called the
Mothers marks, or the Womb marks, of which since
wee have spoke already, wee shall now save the labour
of iteration; seeing our purpose is only to treat of
Physiognomicall signes, where wee shall speak only
of the predestinated signes of the stars, under which
wee understand those signes of Men, which neither
their Father, or Mother had any likenesse of in
their body.</p>

<p>Of this sort are black, gray, little, or great eyes,
long, crooked, sharp, nose, pits in their cheeks, the
cheek-bone being raised up, a flat, or broad nose,
small, or great ears, long neck, long face, wide, or
little mouth, thick or small, many or few, black, yellow,
and red haires, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If one, or more of these signes appear in Man,
you must know, that they doe not want their signification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113a" id="Page_113a"></a>[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>But it is necessary that you consider them according
to the Physiognomicall art, and that you have
certain knowledge of the Art of Signatures, whereby
you may know through the externall signes the
internall man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Black Eyes signifie.</div>

<p>But to proceed to the practise of what we intended,
and to reckon up some of the signes of
Men, and their signification in part.</p>

<p>You must know, that black eyes besides a healthful
constitution, also many times signifie a constant
mind, not wavering, or fearfull, but lusty, hearty, true

memory, attention, diligence, a sound brain, and
head, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Low eares are an ill omen. For, for the most
part they signifie a man to be malitious, fraudulent,
unjust, and a bad hearing, a bad memory, a bold man,
and easily <span class="correction" title="In the original book: explosing">exposing</span> himselfe to dangers.</p>

black, or yellow, or red, or white, and hoary, or
curled, soft, or hard, as any one desires to have
them.</p>

<p>Hence it will come to passe, that many who
are otherwise skilfull enough in the Art of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Physiogmony">Physiognomy</span>
would be most shamefully deceived, whilst
they should rashly judge by the hairs, imputing that
to the stars, which should rather be ascribed to men
themselves.</p>

<p>Yet it cannot bee denyed, but that haires firmly
fastened on the head, doe signifie a good
health of the head, as also of the whole
body.</p>

<p>And this is the reason, why they that buy Horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116a" id="Page_116a"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
pull their tails, that by this means they may judge of

strong and able for any exercise, as beating, pounding,
shooting, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hard hands.</div>

<p>Hands that bee hard signifie a man to bee
laborious, and a hireling, &amp;c. Soft hands, the contrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A short Body.</div>

<p>A short body, and long legs signifie a man to be
a good runner, to bee easily satisfied with meat,
and drinke, and for the most part to bee of a short
life.</p>

<p>Great and clear veines under the middle age of
man signifie a man to be full of bloud and juice, but
above the midle of his age to be commonly sick, yet
long lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothing can be judged <span class="correction" title="In the original book: by by">by</span> the manners, and behaviour of Men.</div>

<p>As much as concerns the manners, gestures of
men, nothing can be so easily known, and judged by
them.</p>

<p>For experience teacheth that these can every moment
bee changed, as to deceive the Signator, and
make him erroneous in his judgement: And because
it hath not been observed hitherto so accurately by
all Astronomers; It is therefore the Signators part
not alwayes to look to the manners and actions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117a" id="Page_117a"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
men, but rather to other signs of the body, which are
fixed, and can by no Art be counterfeited or changed.</p>

<p>For if red hairs, moving the forehead, and eyelids,
a cheerfull, raised, and unmoveable countenance,
a frequent agitation of the mouth, a stout mused
walking, and a light mind, should necessarily declare
a man to be a gallant souldier and stout, every one
could by his industry and art make himselfe seem to
be such an one; that hee might by his lookes bee
the better approved of, and obtaine greater
pay.</p>

<p>The like also may be judged of other kinds of behaviour,
which pretend to wisdom, folly, truth, lying,
fortune, victory, &amp;c.</p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_ASTRALL_SIGNES_OF_CHIROMANCY" title="Of the Astrall Signes of Chiromancy.">
<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of the Astrall Signes of Chiromancy.</i></h4>

<p>Concerning the Signes of Chiromancy, we must
hold that they doe arise from the superiour
stars of the seven planets; and that wee must know
and judge of them by the seven planets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Chiromancy is.</div>

<p>Now Chiromancy is an Art, which doth not
only look into the hands of men, and make judgement
by their lines and wrinkles, but also considers
all hearbs, woods, hard stones, earthes, and rivers,
and whatsoever hath lines, veins, or wrinkles.</p>

<p>Neither doth this Art want its errours, which those
Astronomers were guilty of.</p>

<p>For they assigned the fingers of both hands to the
planets, and chiefest stars, whereas there are but
five fingers in one hand, and in both ten, yet the planets
are reckoned but seven.</p>

<p>How then can these things agree amongst themselves?</p>

<p>Now if there were seven fingers on each hand, it
then might bee granted, that every finger might bee
ascribed to severall planets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether the fingers be assigned to the Planets.</div>

<p>But yet it falls out many times, that some men may
have but seven fingers on both hands, the rest being
casually cut off: but seing that they were cut off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119a" id="Page_119a"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
just seven were not at their birth, this matter cannot
be related hither.</p>

<p>And if it should be so, that a man should bee borne
with seven fingers, whether on one hand, or on both:
yet that were monstrous, and beside the usuall order
of Nature, and not subject to the stars. Therefore
this also cannot belong to this place.</p>

<p>But if there must be but five fingers on each hand,
and seven planets, and these mutually bee compared
amongst themselves, it would then be convenient that
the lots of the planets should be put into a box, to
know which two planets must give place, and bee
left out.</p>

<p>Yet because this cannot bee, and the planets have
neither dice, nor lots in the Firmament; It would be
worth wondering at, if any one should usurp this
power to himself, as to allot by the name of the planet,
and signe, the thumb to <i>Venus</i>, the fore-finger to
<i>Iupiter</i>, the midle-finger to <i>Saturne</i>, the ring-finger
to the <i>Sun</i>, and the little-finger to <i>Mercury</i>, in the
meane time casting out <i>Mars</i>, and the <i>Moon</i>, as it
were out of their tribe and liberty.</p>

<p>Which things being so; who can wonder that
<i>Mars</i> doth stir up his sons with just indignation to kill
that caster of lots, or to beare a perpetuall hatred against
him? Who can wonder why the Moon should
enfeeble the brain of that player, or take away his
reason?</p>

<p>And this is their first errour, which, as wee
have said, they have committed in Chiromancy.</p>

<p>The second errour in it is this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120a" id="Page_120a"></a>[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>It oftentimes happens that the originall, and naturall
lines of the hands are changed by hurts, and
casualties, or are made greater, or lesser, or doe appear
in other places.</p>

<p>For as if there be a high-way obstructed by any
thing or be stopt up by the fall of a mountain, or be
spoiled by the overflowing of waters, men go about
in another way neer to it: so it happens in the old
lines of the hands, that sometimes after the curing of
wounds, or ulcers, together with new flesh, also
new lines doe grow out, and the old are quite abolished.</p>

<p>In the same manner also by reason of hard labours
the lines are defaced, or they which were originall
grow great; as it is in trees: For if a young tree
send forth many branches on all sides, these
being cut off, the tree it selfe becomes bigger.</p>

<p>But that wee may at length proceed to the practise
of the Art of Chiromancy, and briefly declare
our opinion; I would have you know, that I will
indeed change nothing of what concerns the hands,
but acquiesce, and be satisfied with the observations,
and descriptions of the Ancients. Yet I purpose in
this practise of Chiromancy to write of those things,
of which the Ancients have made no mention of, as
of the Chiromancy of Hearbs, Woods, Stones, and
the like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chiromancy of Hearbs and Woods.</div>

<p>And it must first be noted, that all Hearbs, which
are of one kind must be of one, and the same Chiromancy.</p>

<p>But if their lines bee unlike, and appeare greater,
or lesser in some of them: that is, by reason of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121a" id="Page_121a"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
their age. <span class="sidenote">What use is of them.</span>Wee doe therefore clearly professe, that
the Chiromancy of Hearbs, conduceth to nothing
else but to know, and understand the age of any
Hearb, or Root.</p>

<p>But by way of arguing any may here object, that
there is no hearb as long as it growes is older then
another, four or five monthes at the most, if the supputation
begins from May till Autumne, at which
time hearbs die, and fall from their root.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The condition of the spirit of the Hearb.</div>

<p>To this I answer, that from God there is but one
vertue in a root, which is the first being and spirit of
the hearb, by reason of which the hearb grows, and is
supported untill the predestinated time, and untill it
bee exalted to the production of seed. And this is
a sign, and a mark, that the vertue returns back to the
root, and so the hearb is dryed. As long as that spirit
which is the chiefest vertue of the hearb remaines
in the root, the hearb every yeer is renewed: unlesse
it be, that that spirit together with the hearb be taken
way, and decayes. Then the hearb is not renewed. For
the root is dead, and hath no more life remaining in it.</p>

<p>But after what manner that spirit together with the
hearb is taken from the root, or with the root from
the earth, that the vertue thereof cannot goe backe
into the root, or from the root into the earth, is not
to be considered in this place. For that is a sublime
mystery of Nature, and not to be openly discovered
by reason of ignorant Physitians, who doe not only
scoffe at but contemne such secrets. Therefore what
here wee have omitted, wee shall set downe in our
Herball.</p>

<p>Moreover, by how much the younger hearbs are,
so much the more doe they excell in power and vertue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122a" id="Page_122a"></a>[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>As by age a man is weakned, and fails in strength, so
also doe hearbs.</p>

<p>But to know what the Chiromancy, and age of
hearbs, and such like things, is, daily experience is
required, seeing the number of their years is not written
upon them, but it must be divined, as I have said,
by Chiromancy only.</p>

<p>Now Chiromancy doth not consider numbers, letters,
or characters, but lines, veins, and wrinkles only,
&amp;c. according to the age of any thing. For by
how much the older a thing is, so much the greater,
and easier to be seen are the lines, and the vertue, and
operation of the thing so much the duller.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Young hearbs must be applyed to old
diseases, and so on the contrary.</div>

<p>For as a disease of one moneth or yeare, is more
easily cured then that which is of two, three, four,
or five moneths, and years: So an hearb doth sooner
cure a disease of one moneth, or year, then that which
is of two, three, or four moneths, or years. And for
this cause young hearbs must bee applyed to old
griefs; and old hearbs or medicines to young or
new diseases. For if an old hearb should be applyed
to an old disease, the blind would lead the blind, and
both would fall into the ditch.</p>

<p>This is the reason why many medicines doe not
work, but are taken into the body, and possesse the
members, as dirt sticks to the shooes, whence diseases
are afterward doubled, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now ignorant Physitians never considered this,
but by their ignorance have destroyed more then ever
they cured.</p>

<p>In the first place therefore, you that are Physitians
must know, that the medicine must be younger then
the disease, that it may bee stronger to expelle it. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123a" id="Page_123a"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
if the medicine be more powerfull then the disease, the
disease will be overcome as fire is quenched with water.
But if the disease bee stronger then the medicine,
it turnes the medicine into poison, whence diseases are
afterward doubled, and increased.</p>

<p>So if a disease bee like Iron, it must be cured with a
Chalybeat medicine. For Steel cannot be overcome
by Iron. The more powerful doth alwaies overcome,
and the weaker is overcome.</p>

<p>Although therefore it was not our purpose in the
beginning to write in this place of Physick, yet for the
sake of true, and genuine Physitians, I could not pass
over these things in silence.</p>

<h4 id="OF_MINERALL_SIGNES" title="Of Minerall Signes.">
<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of Minerall Signes.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">How Mineralls differ.</div>

<p>Mineralls also, and Metalls before they come to
the fire have their true signes, and significations,
which they have received from the Archeius, and the
superiour stars, every one of them resembling some
kind of them by distinct colours, and differences of
the earth. For the Minerall of Gold, is distinct from
the Minerall of Silver: so also is the Minerall of Silver
from that of Copper: and the Minerall of Copper
from that of Iron: so the Minerall of Iron from
that of Tinne, and Lead, and so of the rest.</p>

<p>No man can deny, but that the Minerall, and all
Metallick bodies of Mines, which lie hid in the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124a" id="Page_124a"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
may be known by art of Chiromancy by their exteriour
signes. That is, the Chiromancy of Mines,
Veines, and Conduits, &amp;c. by which not only those
things, which being hid within them, are brought
forth, but also a certaine depth, and richnesse of the
Mine, and plenty of Metall is manifested. And in this
Chiromancy three things are necessary to be known,
<i>viz.</i> the age, depth, and breadth of the veins, as hath
been said a little before of hearbs. For by how much
the older the veins are, by so much the richer, and
more augmented are the Mines.</p>

<p>Concerning this we must know thus much, that all
Metalls, which as yet lie hid in their matrix doe constantly
grow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There are Three chiefe heads of all things.</div>

<p>Whence also it is manifest, that every thing that
growes, although it be placed out of its matrix cannot
be made lesse, but forthwith grows, (<i>i.e.</i>) is multiplyed,
and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: accordiug">according</span> to its substance, measure, and
weight, grows untill the predestinated time. Now
this predestinated time is the third part, of the appointed
age of all Mineralls, Vegetables, and Animalls,
which are the three chief heads of all earthly
things.</p>

<p>Now whatsoever doth yet remaine in its matrix,
doth grow so long untill the matrix dies. For the
matrix hath its appointed time to live, and die, especially
if it be subject to externall Elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is the tearme of Elements.</div>

<p>That which is not subject to them, hath no other
time, or term then the Elements themselves have,
with which it also shall die and perish in the day of
Renovation (which is their term.)</p>

<p>Hence it follows, that all things which are within
the earth are not subjected to the externall Elements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125a" id="Page_125a"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
neither are they sensible of cold, or moisture, or drynesse,
or wind, or aire, by which they may bee destroyed.
Such kind of bodies therefore cannot bee
putrefied, or contract any filthinesse, or stink, or die,
as long as they continue within the earth, in their
Chaos.</p>

<p>So much be spoken of Metalls, and as of them,
so also it may bee said of many men, who in the
caves of mountaines live some hundreds of years, as
if they were gyants, or pygmies, of which we have
wrote a particular book.</p>

<p>But to descend to the practise of the Chiromancy of
Mines, which wee shall give you to understand in
few words; you must know that the veines by how
much the deeper, and broader they are, so much
the older. For where the course of the veins is a great
way extended, and at length decay, and are not hidden,
it is a bad signe. For as the courses of the veins
doe decay, so also doe the Mines themselves decay,
which they signifie by their depth. Although sometimes
there are good Mines found, yet by how much
the deeper they goe, they doe more, and more decay,
so that it is not worth while to worke in them. But
when the veins are enlarged with other additions, or
oftentimes cut off, it is a good signe, shewing that the
Mines are good not only in the top, but that the same
also are increased, and multiplyed in depth, and
length for the most part, the Mines being made
more rich, afford pure gold, and so a most large
treasure.</p>

<p>It is without ground, that many Miners commend
those veins only which go directly downward, and incline
from the East to the West. For the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126a" id="Page_126a"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
Mines and experience teacheth, that veins oftentimes
which bend from the West to the East, or from the
South to the North, and so contrarily from the
North to the South, are not lesse rich then others are.
Therefore there is no vein to be esteemed before another.
But we think it convenient to discourse of this
no longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By what signes Mines are discovered.</div>

<p>Now concerning the other signes of the internall
earth, as also the colours of Mineralls, we shall briefly
discourse of them thus.</p>

<p>As oft as Miners fall upon a fat earth, which doth
signifie a vein of a pure, and new metall, that is a very
good signe assuring that, that Metall, of which it is a
vein, is not far off.</p>

<p>So also if the earth that is digged have no Metall
in it, but be fat, of a white colour, or black, or like
clay or green, or blue, &amp;c. then that also is a good
signe of some good Metall that is hid under it.
Therefore you must continue digging, and not give
over.</p>

<p>Miners in the first place have respect to the excellent,
beautiful, and chiefest colours, as are green earth,
or Chrysocoll, Verdegrease, Azure, Cinnabar, Sandaracha,
Auripigmentum, Litharge of Gold, and Silver,
&amp;c. every one of these almost doe for the
most part signifie a peculiar Metall, or Minerall.</p>

<p>So Verdegrease, Chrysocolla, green earth, for
most part signifie Copper.</p>

<p>So Azure, or white Arsenick, or Litharge of Silver
signifie the Metall of Copper.</p>

<p>So Cinnabar, and Sandaracha do sometimes signifie
Gold, sometimes Silver, and sometimes a mixture of
both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127a" id="Page_127a"></a>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>So Auripigmentum, red Sulphur, and Litharge of
Gold, for the most part signifie Gold.</p>

<p>So when Chrysocoll is found mixt with the Azure,
or the Azure with Chrysocoll, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Anripigment">Auripigment</span>,
for the most part they signifie an excellent and
rich Minerall.</p>

<p>Where stones, or earth are found of an Iron colour,
they doe certainly betoken an Iron Mine.</p>

<p>You must note, that sometimes it comes to passe,
that the Archeius of the earth doth by some secret
passage cast up some Metall from the more inward
part of the earth. And that is a good signe.</p>

<p>Miners therefore must not bee discouraged when
they see such certaine signes, and hope of some excellent
Mine lying under. And if thin leaves of Metalls,
like Talke, do adhere to rocks, or stones, that is a most
sure sign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Coruscations signifie in Mines.</div>

<p>Now concerning Coruscations they must bee diligently,
and studiously observed, for, they are most
certain signes of Metalls lying hid under them, as also
of the same extent, and same kind. Where yet wee
must note, that those Metalls are not yet come to
perfection, but are as yet in their first being. And whither
soever the Coruscation reacheth, so far also reacheth
the course of Metalls, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coruscations are of three colours.</div>

<p>Moreover you must know, that Coruscation is of a
threefold colour, as White, Yellow, and Red, whereby
all Metalls are discovered to us. For a white Coruscation
signifies white Metalls, as Tinne, Lead, Silver,
&amp;c. a red Coruscation signifies red Metalls, as
Copper, and Iron, &amp;c. a yellow Coruscation signifies
golden Metalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128a" id="Page_128a"></a>[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Add moreover, that a thin, and subtil Coruscation
is the best signe.</p>

<p>For as you see it is in trees, that by how much the
fewer flowers there are, so much the better, greater,
and more savory are the fruit: so also small and subtile
Coruscations signifie subtile and excellent Metalls,
as the contrary doe the contrary.</p>

<p>Moreover you must know, that as long as those
Coruscations appear, whether they be great, or small,
or of this or that colour, the Metalls in those Mines
have not yet attained to perfection, but are yet in their
first being as the sperm of a man in the matrix of a
woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Coruscation is.</div>

<p>But now what Coruscation is, wee must consider
in this place: and we must know that it appears in the
Mines by night like a sparkling fire, no otherwise then
gunpowder that is laid in a long train, and being kindled
at one end makes a long flashing.</p>

<p>After the same manner is Coruscation carried
along, from the East to the West, or from the
West to the East, from the South to the North, or
contrarily.</p>

<p>All these Coruscations, how ever they appear, are a
certain signe of Courses of Metalls, that by them
they may be known, and Metalls as certain gifts of
God may be brought forth out of the earth. For
what God created for mans use, hee put that nature
into it that it should not be hid: and although it were
hid, yet he made peculiar externall signes which conduce
to the finding of it out, by which the wonderful
predestination of it may be known.</p>

<p>In the same manner if men hide treasures they
marke the place with some certain marks, and bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129a" id="Page_129a"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
them by some bound, statue, or fountaine, or any
other thing, that when there is occasion they may
find, and dig them up again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Chaldeans and Grecians hide their treasure.</div>

<p>The ancient <i>Chaldeans</i> and <i>Grecians</i>, if in times of
war fearing to be driven away, or banished, they would
hide their treasure, would marke the place no otherwise,
then propose to themselves a certain day, hour,
and minute of the year, and did observe in what place
the Sun, or Moon should cast their shadow, and there
did bury, and hide their treasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Sciomancy is.</div>

<p>This Art they call <i>Sciomancy</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Art of
Shadowing. By these shadowings many Arts have
had their ground, and many hid things have been
revealed, and all Spirits, and Astrall bodies are
known.</p>

<p>These are Cabalisticall signes, that cannot deceive,
and therefore diligently to bee taken notice
of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divining Rods uncertaine.</div>

<p>You must therefore take heed, that you suffer not
your selves to be seduced by the divinations of uncertain
Arts; for they are vain, and fruitlesse, especially
Divining rods, which have deceived many Miners.
For if they shew a thing truly once, they faile ten
times.</p>

<p>Also wee must not trust other fraudulent signes of
the devill, which are made, and appeare in the night,
and at some inconvenient times preternaturally, such
as are ghosts, &amp; visions. For I would have you know,
that the devill can shew, and cause signes, but out of
meer fraud, and deceit.</p>

<p>So there is no Church built, but the devill hath his
Chappell there. There is no Chappell built, but hee
sets up his Altar. There is no good seed, but hee sows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130a" id="Page_130a"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
amongst it his tares. The same is the nature of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Visisions">Visions</span>,
and supernaturall Apparitions, in Crystalls,
Berills, Looking-glasses, and Waters, as they are
by Ceremoniall Negromancers contrary to Gods
command, and the power of the light of Nature basely
abused.</p>

<p>Visions indeed are not absolutely to be rejected;
for they have their place, but then they must bee
done after another processe. For now wee are not
any longer in the first generation, but the second.
Ceremonies therefore, and Conjurations are
not any longer to be used by us Christians in the regeneration,
as the Ancients in the old Testament, who
lived in the first generation used them. For those prefigurations
were for us who were to live in the New
Testament.</p>

<p>Whatsoever things therefore the Ancients that
were under the Old Testament, and in the first Generation
did doe by Ceremonies, Conjurations, &amp;c.
wee Christians of the second Generation, and in the
New Testament must doe by prayer, knocking, and
seeking, and procure by faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In what chiefe points the foundations of
Magick and Cabalie consists.</div>

<p>In these 3 chief points consists all the foundation of
the Magicall, and Cabalisticall Art, by which wee
may obtain whatsoever we desire, so that to us Christians
nothing is impossible.</p>

<p>But wee shall desist to treat here of more things
concerning these and other monuments of Cabalie,
spoken of sufficiently in the book of <i>Visions</i>. I refer
you thither, that you may see how wonderfully Christ
the Son of God works by his Angells in us Christians,
and the faithfull, and how brotherly he is conversant
with us. Whence we are the true Angels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131a" id="Page_131a"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
members of Christ, as hee is our head, as hee is in us,
so we live in him, as is taught in the booke of the
Lords Supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is the vertue of the Tincture of Philosophers.</div>

<p>But to returne to our purpose concerning Minerall
signes, and especially concerning the Coruscation of
Metalline veins, we must know, that as Metalls, which
are yet in their first being, send forth their Coruscation,
<i>i.e.</i> Signes, so also the <i>Tincture of Philosophers</i>,
which changeth all imperfect Metalls into Silver, and
Gold (or White Metalls into Silver, and Red into
Gold) puts forth its proper signs like unto Coruscation,
if it be Astrally perfected, and prepared. For as
soon as a small quantity of it is cast upon a fluxil metall,
so that they mixe together in the fire; there ariseth
a naturall Coruscation, and brigthnesse, like to
that of fine Gold, or Silver in a test, which then is
a signe that that Gold, or Silver, is freed and
purged without all manner of addition of other Metalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Tincture of Philosophers is made astrall.</div>

<p>But how the Tincture of Philosophers is made Astrall,
you must conceive it after this manner:</p>

<p>First of all you must know, that every Metall, as
long as it lies hid in its first being, hath its certaine
peculiar stars.</p>

<p>So Gold hath the stars of the Sun, Silver the stars
of the Moon, Copper the stars of Venus, Iron the
stars of Mars, Tinne the stars of Jupiter, Lead the
stars of Saturne, Quicksilver the starres of Mercury.</p>

<p>But as soon as they come to their perfection, and
are coagulated into a fixt Metalline body, their stars
fall off from them, and leave them, as a dead
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132a" id="Page_132a"></a>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Hence it follows, that all such bodies are afterwards
dead, and inefficacious, and that the unconquered star
of Metalls doth overcome them all, and converts
them into its nature, and makes them all Astrall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold that is made by the Tincture is better then naturall.</div>

<p>For which cause also our Gold, and Silver, which
is tinged, and prepared with our tincture, is much
more excellent, and better for the preparation of Medicinall
secrets, then that which is naturall, which
Nature generates in the Mines, and afterwards is separated
from other Metalls.</p>

<p>So also the Mercury of a body, is made Astrally
of another body, and is much more noble, and fixt
then common Mercury. And so of the other Metalls.</p>

<p>I say therefore, that every Alchymist, which hath
that star of Gold, can turne all Red Metalls into
Gold by tinging of them.</p>

<p>So by the star of Silver all White Metalls are changed
into Silver: by the star of Copper into Copper:
by the star of Quicksilver into Mercury of the body;
and so of the rest.</p>

<p>But now how all these stars are prepared according
to the Spagiricall Art, it is not our purpose at
this time to declare: but the explication of them
belongs to our bookes of the Transmutation of
Metalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of the red Tincture.</div>

<p>But as for that which concerns their signes, I would
have you know, that our Red tincture, which contains
the stars of Gold to bee of a most fixt substance, of
most quick penetration, and of a most intense redness,
in powder resembling the colour of Saffron, but
in its whole body the colour of a Rubie; I say it
is a Tincture as fluxil as Wax, as transparent as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133a" id="Page_133a"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
Crystall, as brittle as Glasse, and for weight most
heavy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of the white.</div>

<p>The white tincture, which containes the star of the
Moon is after the same manner of a fixt substance, of
an unchangeable quantity, of wonderfull whitenesse,
as fluid as Resine, as transparent as Crystall, as
brittle as Glasse, and for weight like to a Diamond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The star of Copper.</div>

<p>The star of Copper is of a wonderfull citrine colour,
like to an Emrald, as fluxill as Resine, much
heavier then its Metall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The star of white Tin.</div>

<p>The starre of white Tinne is as fluid as Resine,
of a darke colour with some mixture of yellow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The star of Iron.</div>

<p>The star of Iron is very red, as transparent as
a Granate, as fluxil as Resine, as brittle as Glasse,
of a fixt substance, much heavier then its Metall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The star of Lead.</div>

<p>The star of Lead is like Cobaltum, black, yet
transparent, as fluxile as Resine, as brittle as
Glasse, equall to Gold for weight, heavier then other
Lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The star of Quicksilver.</div>

<p>The star of Quicksilver is of a wonderfull white,
sparkling colour, like to snow, in the extreamest cold
weather, very subtile, of a penetrating, corrosive acrimony,
as transparent as Crystall, flowing as easily
as Resine, very cold to the tast, but very hot
within, as if it were fire, but of a very volatil substance
in the fire.</p>

<p>By this description the stars of the Metalls are to
be known, and understood.</p>

<p>Also you must understand, that for the preparation
of both tinctures, <i>viz.</i> of the Red and White, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134a" id="Page_134a"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
must not in the beginning take of your work the body
of Gold, or Silver, but the first being of Gold, and
Silver. For if in the beginning there be an errour
committed all your pains, and labour will be in vain.</p>

<p>So also you must understand of Metalls, that
every one of them receives a peculiar signe in the
fire, by which it is known.</p>

<p>Of this kind are sparks, flames, glisterings, the colour,
smell, taste of fire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>So the true signe of Gold, or Silver in the test is
glistering.</p>

<p>That appearing, it is certain that Lead, and other
Metalls that were mixed are fumed away, and that
the Gold, and Silver is fully purged.</p>

<p>The signes of Iron being red hot in the furnace, are
cleer transparent sparks flying upward. Those appearing,
the Iron unlesse it be taken from the fire is
burnt like straw, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know how Metalls have more or less of
the three principles.</div>

<p>After the same manner any earthly body shews
its peculiar, and distinct signes in the fire, whether
it have more of Mercury, Sulphur, or Salt, and which
of the three principles it hath most of. For if it fume
before it flame, it is a signe that it containes more
Mercury then Sulphur.</p>

<p>But if it <span class="correction" title="In the original book: presenlly">presently</span> burn with a flame, and without
any fume, it is a signe that it contains much Sulphur,
and little or no Mercury.</p>

<p>This you see in fat substances, as Tallow, Oyle,
Resine, and the like: but if without any flame it goes
all into fume, it is a signe that there is in it much Mercury,
and little or no Sulphur.</p>

<p>This you see happens in hearbs, and flowers, &amp;c.
and other Vegetable substances, and volatile bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135a" id="Page_135a"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
as are Mineralls, and Metalls, remaining yet in their
first being, and are not mixed with any sulphureous
body, which send forth a fume, and no flame.</p>

<p>Mineralls, and Metalls, which send forth neither
fume nor flame, doe shew an equall mixtion
of Mercury, and Sulphur, and a perfect fixation.</p>

<span class="figcenter">
<img src="images/h_2.jpg" class="imgc" alt="*decorative divider*" />
</span><br />
<i>Of some peculiar Signes of Naturall and Supernaturall things.</i></h4>

<p>Wee must yet further speak of some peculiar
signes, of which hitherto we have said nothing.</p>

<p>In which Treatise it will be very necessary for you,
that boast your selves to have skill in the Art of Signatures,
and desire to be called Signators, that you
rightly understand mee. For wee shall not in this
place write theoretically, but practically, and shall
declare our opinion in few words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the art of signing is.</div>

<p>And first know, that the Art of signing doth teach
how true, and sutable names are to bee put upon all
things, all which <i>Adam</i> truly knew. For presently after
the Creation hee gave to every thing its proper
name, as to Animalls, so to Trees, Hearbs, Rootes,
Stones, Mineralls, Metalls, Waters, &amp;c. And to all
the fruits of the earth, Water, Air, Fire, &amp;c. And what
names he put upon them all, were ratified, and approved
of by God. For from the true, and intrinse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136a" id="Page_136a"></a>[Pg 136]</span>call
foundation he tooke them all; not from opinion,
or from a predestinated science, <i>viz.</i> the Art of Signing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adam the first signator.</div>

<p><i>Adam</i> therefore was the first Signator. And it cannot
be denyed, that also from the <i>Hebrew</i> tongue true
and proper names doe flow, and are put upon every
thing according to its nature, and condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of the Hebrew tongue.</div>

<p>For what names are put upon them from the <i>Hebrew</i>
tongue, doe with the same labour signifie their vertue,
power, and property.</p>

<p>So when wee say, this is a Hog, a Horse, a Cow, a
Beare, a Dog, a Fox, a Sheep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signification of a Hog, Horse, Cow, Beare, Fox,
Dog, sheep, in the Hebrew tongue.</div>

<p>The name of a Hog signifies together with it a filthy
and unclean Animall: so a Horse signifies a strong
and patient Animall: a Cow, a devouring, and insatiable
beast: a Bear, a strong, victorious, and an untamed
brute: a Fox, a shifting, and crafty beast: a Dog, an
animall false to those of his own kind: a Sheep, a mild
and profitable beast, and hurtful to none.</p>

<p>Hence it is that a man is called a Hog, for his sordid
and swinish life.</p>

<p>And a Horse for his bearing, for which hee is
eminent.</p>

<p>And a Cow, because shee is unsatiable with meat,
and drink, and knows no measure of her belly.</p>

<p>And a Bear, because he is mishapen, and stronger
then other men.</p>

<p>A Fox, because he is a turn-coat, and deceitfull, accommodating
himselfe to all, and offending none.</p>

<p>A Dog, because he is faithfull to none, but his own
mouth, is false, and inofficious to all.</p>

<p>And a Sheep, because hee hurts no body but himselfe,
and is usefull to all, rather then to himself, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137a" id="Page_137a"></a>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In what hearbs there is a signature.</div>

<p>After this manner also many Hearbs, and Rootes
have got their name.</p>

<p>So Eye-bright is so called, because it cures weak,
and sore eyes.</p>

<p>So the Root Bloudwort is so called, because it
stops bloud better then any other.</p>

<p>So the Hearb Pile-wort is so called, because it cures
the piles better then other hearbs.</p>

<p>The same also may be said of divers other hearbs, of
which sort I could reckon a great number, all which
were so called from their vertue, and faculty, as shall
more largely be declared in our Herball.</p>

<p>Moreover, there bee many Hearbs, and Rootes,
which are denominated not only from their imbred
vertue, and faculty, but also from their figure, forme,
and representation: As, Devills-bit, Five-leaved
grasse, or Cinquefoile, Hounds-tongue, Adders-tongue,
Horse-taile, Liver-wort, Ox-tongue, Lungwort,
the hearb Chameleon, St. Johns-wort, or the
hearb boared through, the hearb Dog-stone, Tongue-laurell,
Thorow-leafe, Turne-sole, and many others
which shall not here, but in the Herball bee severally
considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What signature there is in Animalls.</div>

<p>The same also holds concerning the signes of Animalls;
for by the bloud, and its circle, and by the
urine and its circle all diseases that lie hid in Man may
be known.</p>

<p>By the liver of a slain beast the flesh is known whether
it be wholsome to be eaten or no. For unlesse the
liver be clear, and of a red colour, but blew, or yellow,
or rough, or full of holes, the beast is diseased,
and therefore his flesh unwholsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138a" id="Page_138a"></a>[Pg 138]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Liver the originall of Bloud.</div>

<p>And it is no wonder that the liver can shew that by
naturall signes. For the originall of the bloud is in
the liver, and hence through the veins it is diffused into
the whole body, and is coagulated into flesh.</p>

<p>Therefore from a diseased, and ill affected liver, no
sound or fresh bloud can be produced, as of bad bloud
no wholsome flesh can be coagulated.</p>

<p>Also without inspection into the liver, flesh and
bloud may be known. For if both be sound, they
have their true, and naturall colour, which is red, and
clear, mixed with no other strange colour, as yellow,
or blew. For those strange colours do signifie diseases,
and sicknesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the knots in the Navell of the Infant signifie.</div>

<p>Also there are other signes worthy of admiration,
<i>viz.</i> when the Archeius is the Signator, and signes
the navell in the infant with little knots, by which
it may bee conjectured, what the Mother of the infant
did bring forth, or shall bring forth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The branches of a Harts horn signifie his age.</div>

<p>The same Signator signs the horns of a Hart with
branches, by which his age is known. For as many
branches as the horn hath, so many years old is the
Hart. And seeing he hath every year a new horn, the
age of the Hart may be known to twenty, or thirty
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The circles of the hornes of a Cow what.</div>

<p>So the Signator of a Cow markes her hornes with
circles, by which it may be known how many Calves
shee hath brought forth. For every Circle signifies
a Calfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teeth of a Horse.</div>

<p>The same Signator puts forth the first teeth of a
Horse, that the first seven yeers his age may be known
by his teeth. For at first a Horse is brought forth,
with fourteen teeth, of which every yeer hee loseth
two, and so in the space of seven yeares hee loseth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139a" id="Page_139a"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
all. So that after seven yeares his age can hardly
be known, unlesse by one that is very skilful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bills and claws of Birds.</div>

<p>The same Signator doth signe the bills and claws of
Birds with peculiar signes, that the skilfull Fowler
may know their age by them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tongues of Hogs.</div>

<p>The same Signator doth marke the tongues of
diseased Hogs with little pushes, by which their impurity
is known, and as their tongue is impure, so is
their whole body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colours of Clouds.</div>

<p>The same Signator doth signe clouds with divers
colours, by which the seasons of the heaven may bee
foreknown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colours of the circle of the Moon.</div>

<p>So also he signs the circle of the moon with distinct
colours, of which every one is of peculiar interpretation.
So redness signifies that there wil be wind; greennesse,
and blacknesse, raine, these two mixed together
wind and rain, the same in the sea is a signe of great
storms, and tempests; clearnesse, and a bright whitenesse
is a good sign, especially in the ocean. For, for the
most part it signifies a quiet, faire season.</p>

<p>Whatsoever the Moon portends by her signs, shall
come to passe the next day.</p>

<p>And so much for Naturall signes. Now for Supernaturall
signes, they are things of a particular science,
as of Magical Astronomy, &amp;c. and the like. It is therefore
necessary that you be skilled in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kinds of Magicall Astronomie.</div>

<p>Hence also many other Arts proceed, as Geomancy,
Pyromancy, Hydromancy, Chaomancy, and
Necromancy, whereof every one hath its peculiar
stars, which stars doe so signe them after a supernaturall
manner. And you must know, that the starres of
Geomancy impresse their signs upon the earthy bodies
of the whole Universe, and that divers wayes. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140a" id="Page_140a"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
they change the earth, and cause earthquakes, and
gapings, they produce hills, and valleys, and bring
many new Vegetables, they produce also <span class="correction" title="See Transcriber’s Note">Gamaheaus</span>
with naked figures, and images, having
wonderfull vertues, and powers, which indeed they
receive from the seven planets, as the But or mark receives
the arrow from the Archer.</p>

<p>But how those signs, and images of Gamaheaus
may be known apart, and what they signifie magically;
there is required a great experience, and knowledg
of the nature of things, which can by no meanes bee
here perfectly taught.</p>

<p>Here you must well note, that the stone, or every
Gamaheaus, cannot excell in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: prperty">property</span>, and vertue
but of one star, and so be qualified but by one planet.</p>

<p>And although there bee two or more planets in
earthly bodies, as they are joined together in the superiour
firmament: yet one is repressed by the other.
For as one house cannot bear two Masters, but the
one thrusts out the other: so also it is here; the one
rules, the other serves: Or as one that overcomes him
that keeps any house, casts him out by force; <span class="correction" title="In the original book: and and">and</span>
sets himself, as master of the house, disposing of
all things according to his pleasure, and making the
other his servant.</p>

<p>So also one starre expells another, one planet
another, one Ascendant another, one influence
another, one impression another, one Element
another; For as water quencheth the fire; so one
planet destroyes the property of another, and brings
in its owne.</p>

<p>The same is after the same manner to be under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141a" id="Page_141a"></a>[Pg 141]</span>stood
of their signes, which are manifold, and not
only characters, as many conceive, but all those, which
are found in the whole map of the planets, <i>i.e.</i> whatsoever
are of affinity with, or subject to the planets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What things are subject to the Sun.</div>

<p>But that you may the better understand mee by
adding an example: I would have you know, that
unto the planet of the Sun are subjected a crowne, a
scepter, a throne, and all kingly power, majesty, and
rule, and all riches, treasures, ornaments, and furniture
of this world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to the Moone.</div>

<p>Unto the planet of the Moon are subjected all
husbandry, navigation, travelling, and travellers, and
such things as belong to these.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to Mars.</div>

<p>Unto the planet of <i>Mars</i> are subjected all fortifications,
armour, coats for defence, Ordnance of War,
spears, and all weapons, and whatsoever belongs
to war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to Mercury.</div>

<p>Unto the planet of Mercury are subjected all
Artists, all Mechanick instruments, and whatsoever
is required to Arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to Iupiter.</div>

<p>Unto the planet of Jupiter are subjected all
judgments, and rights, the whole Leviticall order,
all Ministers of Churches, ornaments of Temples, all
jewells, and such like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to Venus.</div>

<p>Unto the planet of Venus are subjected whatsoever
things belong to Musick, as Musicall instruments,
venereall exercises, loves, whorings, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to Saturn.</div>

<p>Unto Saturne are subjected whosoever work in and
beneath the earth, as Miners, Pioners, Bearers of the
dead, Diggers of Wells, as also all instruments serving
to either of these, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What be the signes of Pyromancy.</div>

<p>Pyromancy draws forth its signes by the stars of
the fire, in common fire by particular sparkes, flames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142a" id="Page_142a"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
or noise, &amp;c. in the mines by Coruscations: in the
Firmament by stars, comets, flashing, and lightning,
and Nostock, and the like: in Visions by Salamandrine,
and fiery spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the signes of Hydromancy are.</div>

<p>Hydromancy gives its signes by the stars of the
Water, by their overflowings, their scarcity, discolourings,
commotions, new streames, the washings
away of earthy things: in Magick, and Necromancy
by Nymphs, visions and supernaturall Monsters in
the waters, and sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What are the signes of Chaomancy.</div>

<p>Chaomancy shews its signes by the stars of the
Aire, and Wind, by the discolouring, destroying of
all tender, and subtill things, to which the Wind is an
enemie, by beating off the flowers, leaves, boughes,
and branches. If the stars of Chaomancy are moved,
spirits fall from the superiour Aire, and voices, and answers
are often heard: Also Trees are pulled up by the
rootes, and Houses are thrown down. There are seen
Hobgoblins, Houshold Gods, airy spirits, and Woodmen,
&amp;c. also a heavenly dew, and manna falls upon
Trees, and Hearbs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signes of Necromancy.</div>

<p>Necromancy draws forth its signs by the stars of
Death, which we call <i>Evestra</i>, which are prophetical
spirits, signing the body of the sick, and dying man
with red, blue, and purple spots, which are certaine
signs of death, in the third day of their rising. They
sign also the hands, and fingers of men with a clay colour,
which are certain signs of change, either good or
bad. When therfore the stars of Necromancy are moved,
then the dead shew some wonderful sign, as Bleeding,
and voices are heard out of the graves: tumults,
&amp; tremblings arise in the places where bones are laid,
and dead men appear in the form, and habit of living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143a" id="Page_143a"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
men, and are seen in Visions, in Looking-glasses, in
Berills, in Stones, and Waters, and divers shapes.
<i>Evestra</i>, <i>i.e.</i> spirits give their signs by beating, striking,
knocking, falling, casting, &amp;c. where there is a
great hurly burly and noise only heard, but nothing
seen, all which are certain signes of death, presaging
it to him, in whose habit they appear, or to some in
what place they are heard.</p>

<p>Besides, these signatures many more may be reckoned
up. But seeing they bring with them, evill, hurtfull
and dangerous fancies, and imaginations, and
superstitions, which may be an occasion not onely of
some misfortune, but also death, I shall passe them
over in silence. They are prohibited from being
revealed to us, seeing they belong to the schoole of
secrets, and divine power. Therefore now I shall put
an end to this book.</p>

<p><i>Archeius</i> is the highest, exalted, and invisible spirit,
which is separated from bodies, is exalted, and
ascends, the universall occult nature, operator, and
Physitian in all things. So Archiatrus is the supream
Physitian of Nature, which distributes to every thing
and every member their peculiar Archeius occultly
by Ares. Also Archeius is the first in Nature, the
most secret vertue, producing all things out of
Iliaste, being supported by a divine power. Ares is the
dispenser of Nature hid in all the three principles,
whence every thing hath its being, and which disposeth
to all things in a particular form, shape, and substance,
that it may put on its own proper specifical nature,
&amp; not anothers. But you must note, the difference
betwixt these 3 in nature, to speak after the manner of
schools. Iliastes is the substance of the highest genus,
or kind consisting in the first universall matter of all
things, which it doth first dispose into three kinds, <i>viz.</i>
into Sulphur, Mercury, and salt. The Archeius is the
first dispenser of Nature, and then it produceth all
things into its next genera or kinds. Then comes Ares
another dispenser of Nature, which produceth
from kinds, or genera, forms, and species into individualls.</p>

of breathing.</p>

<p><i>Astrum</i> is in this place called the vertue and power
got by the preparations of things as the star of Sulphur
is its inflaming which is turned into most excellent
oyle: so the star of salt is its resolution into water,
or oyle, which thereby receives more vertues then it
had before. The star of Mercury is its sublimation,
by which it acquires a wonderfull power, and
vertue, greater, and more subtile then its naturall.</p>

<p><i>Astrum ex igne</i>, is a burning Fire of great impression.</p>

<p><i>Athanor</i>, or <i>Athanar</i> is a furnace in the spagirical
Art, but especially a reverberatory, sometimes of

which have a power to draw to them such things as
are compounded of the like attractives.</p>

<p><i>Attramentum</i> signifies divers things according to
the adjective that is put to it: as that which Shoomakers
use, is Copperis, such as is red within:
that which Writers use, is called inke, sooty,
and it is called blacking, also all kinds of Copperis.</p>

<p><i>Augurista</i> is called a superstitious Artist who
practiseth his Art in Looking-glasses, Chrystalls, and
in Waters, especially in the singing, and flying of
birds, that he may presage by them; he also observes

Gold, or malleated Gold.</p>

of men.</p>

into the highest degree of rednesse, like ground Cinnabar.
That is the best which is made, and precipitated
with its proper Mercury.</p>

<p><i>Austromantia</i> is a certain kind of superstition invented,
concerning the observation of Winds, as when

something to come.</p>

which ascends, and then descends for nourishment.</p>

things.</p>

<i>Persians</i> were most diligent seekers of this Art, being
also professors of the same, as appears by their calling
of their wise men. They call their Priests wise
men, and most skilfull of all secrets, such as were
those three that came to Christ out of the East to
worship him, and not Kings, as the ignorant vulgar
think them to be. It was not set down in writing, but
delivered by word of mouth. Now after a while superstitious
men, a kind of apes, began to spatter it
with their pen, so that at last it is degenerated into
monstrous superstition; by which means also Magick,
which is the true wisdome that is received by divine
inspiration, is accounted in these times Necromancy,
and Nigromancy, so that it is an offence to be a wise
man, and hee that professeth it openly shall cast himselfe
into danger. But to teach the foolishnesse of Infidels
publickly is commendable, and a gift of singular

<p>Please be aware that in the centuries since this book was written,
medical science has progressed. The medical treatments and medicines
recommended in this book should only be used under guidance of a
trained medical professional. Many of the medicines suggested are now
known to be deleterious to your health or poisonous.</p>

<p>Archaic, obsolete and inconsistent spellings have been included as
in the original book. When this book was written, English was just
beginning to distinguish between I and J, and U and V. There are many
words where these letters will appear to be transposed.</p>

<p>Most of the archaic and obsolete spellings are homophones for the
spelling used today, however there were some notable exceptions:</p>

<table class="tmar1" id="spell" summary="New spellings of obscure old spellings.">
<colgroup><col /><col class="col-wid" /><col /></colgroup>

<tr><td>Jngat</td><td></td><td>Ingot</td></tr>
<tr><td>malitious</td><td></td><td>malicious</td></tr>
<tr><td>pretious</td><td></td><td>precious</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Research indicates that “Archeus” and “Archeius” are inconsistent
spellings of the same word.</p>

<p>The words “cachymie”, “cachymia” and “cachyma” do not appear in any of the
usual sources for English words. They appear to be attempts to Anglicize
the Latin word “Cachymia” (pl. “Cachymiæ”), which Paracelsus used to mean an
“imperfect metallic body”.</p>


<p><span class="mobile-only">In the mobile versions of this text,
where a planet appears in square brackets,
the original book had the appropriate astrological symbol
instead.</span> In versions of this book without images, the first
letter of each chapter or section will appear offset. In the version
with images, these offset letters are replaced by drop-caps.</p>

<p>In the original book, the first letter of some words was in italics, while the
rest of the word was in normal font. This has been maintained in the HTML and e-book
formats, however these specific italics were dropped in the text version of the book.</p>

<p>In the original book, in the sub-book <i>On the Nature of Things</i>,
the page numbering went from 104 to 107, with no 105 and 106 intervening.
The catch-word on page 104 matched the first word of 107 and the text
appeared to continue on 107 from the gist on 104. This and other sources
indicate that 105 and 106 were skipped. In this e-book, the pages in <i>On
the Nature of Things</i> have been renumbered from
107 to the end of the sub-book
to make the page numbering continuous.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents was moved to the front of the book
and expanded to cover the entire book.
It was originally located between <i>A Treatise of Sulphur</i> and <i>On the
Nature of Things</i>, and only covered the twelve treatises of <i>A New
Light of Alchymie</i> and <i>A Treatise of Sulphur</i>.</p>

<p>The Chymicall Dictionary was re-alphabetized in order to make it
easier to use. Also in the Chymicall Dictionary, in the original book,
there were no drop-caps for “W” and “Y”.</p>

<p class="mobile-only">The cover was produced by the transcriber and is
placed in the public domain.</p>
<p>Typos which could be identified have been fixed, details follow. The
word or words in the square brackets are the correction which appears
in this book.</p>
